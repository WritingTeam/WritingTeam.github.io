## Known issues

Apostrophes aren't searching properly (curly in SG, but straight in search box). 
Work-around for now: When searching the web page, copy from the text apostrophes under the search box.

Macrons aren't searching ideally (treated as different letter by search).
Work-around for now: When editing in Word, add non-macronised version in the extra column, with strikethrough.

## Technical
This guide runs on the [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) system.
