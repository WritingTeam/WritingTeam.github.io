Te Papa follows general trends in its treatment of abbreviations, especially the use of punctuation, capital letters, and spacing. Current trends are particularly influenced by digital media and are towards the simplest consistent practice. However, the main consideration is to avoid ambiguity and ensure that the text makes sense to the reader.

General usage

Generally avoid using abbreviations in isolation, unless they are universally known. Consider the context.

Events text

For events/marketing text and timetables, abbreviations of months and days of the week are often appropriate, especially if being used in a mobile context. Use three-letter abbreviations.

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

Exhibition usage

Generally avoid abbreviations in running text for labels. Keep in mind ease of comprehension, particularly for the international audience. However, you may use universally known contractions for titles (Mr, Mrs, Dr) and geographic features (Mt, St), as well as phrases such as ‘percent’. These are self-explanatory for most readers, including speakers of languages other than English.

Be judicious in the use of acronyms. Spell out at first mention all but the most familiar acronyms.

eg, ie, etc, &, +

As above, avoid these abbreviations except where space is limited (eg, in events text or tables). When using the abbreviated forms, don’t place full stops after each letter.

eg not e.g.

ie not i.e.

Place a comma before and after ‘eg’ and ‘ie’.

Expect to see oceanic birds, eg, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses.

Bring your basic weaving kit, ie, scraper, knife, scissors, notebook, and pen.

Punctuation

Don’t use full stops for any of the following abbreviations.

Contractions (abbreviations that retain the first and last letters of a word)
Mr (Mister), Dr (Doctor), Mt (Mount), Ltd (Limited), dept (department)

Suspensions (abbreviations formed from the initial letter/s of a word)
Rev (Reverend), p 37 (page 37)

Acronyms and initialisms (abbreviations formed from the initial letters of a set of words)
Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps), Eftpos (electronic funds transfer – point of sale)

UN (United Nations), TAB (Totalisator Agency Board), am (ante meridiem), eg (exempli gratia)

Also see acronyms

Symbols

Symbols are characters or signs that represent rather than abbreviate a word or set of words. Like abbreviations, symbols don’t take full stops.

km (kilometre), C (Celsius), % (percent), NNW (north-north-west)

Initials

Don’t use full stops after people’s initials but place single spaces between them.

M T Woollaston, John A Lee

Awards and qualifications

When abbreviating awards and qualifications, use capitals (with lower-case letters where necessary), closed up and with no full stops.

BA, NZOM, PhD, BSc

Country and region names

Don’t abbreviate country and region names. Spell them out in full, except when referring to currency or where space is limited (eg, in a table).

New Zealand not NZ, United Kingdom not UK

Page numbers

Spell out ‘page’, except where space is limited (eg, in a table or reference list). When using the abbreviated form, use ‘p’ (page) or ‘pp’ (pages), with a space after and no full stop.

pp 21–22, p 14



Aborigine, Aboriginal

For the indigenous people of Australia, ‘Aborigine’ is the noun, ‘Aboriginal’ is the adjective. Both carry initial capitals.

Use ‘Aboriginal peoples’ or ‘Aboriginal communities’ in preference to ‘Aborigines’.



academic subjects

See awards and qualifications and capitals (academic subjects and qualifications).



acknowledgement



Also see

-dgment vs -dgement

Use ‘acknowledgement’ not ‘acknowledgment’.



acronyms



Also see

abbreviations

Spelling out

Spell out acronyms/initialisms on first mention (with the acronym/initialism in parentheses). Use the acronym/initialism alone in other instances, unless those instances are some distance from the first mention, in which case spell out again.

Alexander Turnbull Library (ATL)

You don’t need to spell out acronyms or initialisms that are almost universally known or more common than the source words.

Anzac, CD, DVD

Capitalisation: acronyms versus initialisms

Distinguish between acronyms (groups of letters that are pronounced as a single word) and initialisms (groups of letters that are sounded out separately).

For acronyms, generally use an initial capital followed by lower-case letters, especially if the acronym is an organisational name. Don’t place spaces or full stops between the letters.
Anzus, Anzac, Unesco, Unicef, Nato, Eftpos, Aids

For initialisms, generally use full capitals, even when the original words are lower case. Don’t place spaces or full stops between the letters.
UN, TAB, GST, TVNZ, EQC, PDF

PM (prime minister), MP (member of Parliament)

Exceptions to the capitalisation rule include am (ante meridiem) and eg (exempli gratia).
Plurals

Plural acronyms don’t take apostrophes. Use a small ‘s’ beside the acronym. Apostrophes are used only to indicate possession, as in the second example below.

CDs not CD’s

The CDs were stolen from the CEO’s office. 



active verbs

See sentences (active and passive verbs).



AD and BC



Also see

BCE and CE

These are abbreviations for the eras Anno Domini (in the year of Our Lord) and Before Christ.

Place both abbreviations after the date, with a space. Use capitals, not small capitals as is sometimes prescribed. Don’t place commas in the dates.

2000 BC, 1200 AD, 5th century AD

Usage

The abbreviations AD and BC are increasingly being replaced by the secular references CE (Common Era) and BCE (before the Common Era). In some contexts and for some audiences, using ‘3,000 years ago’ may be more appropriate than using ‘1000 BCE’ or ‘1000 BC’. (Notice the comma in ‘3,000 years ago’ but not 1000 BCE – this is correct.)



adjectival hyphens

See adverbs that qualify adjectives.



adjectives

See commas (adjectives).



adverbial clauses

See commas (introductory clauses and phrases).



adverbs that qualify adjectives



Also see

hyphens

Use a hyphen between a common or short adverb and the adjective it qualifies when placed before the noun.

a little-known singer, a well-prepared speech, a hard-fought game, a long-term project

Drop the hyphen when the phrase comes after the noun and verb.

The speech was well prepared.

The game was hard fought.

Don’t use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly.

sharply rising profit, poorly made product



adviser

Use ‘adviser’, not ‘advisor’.



affect vs effect

In the most common uses of these words, ‘affect’ is a verb and ‘effect’ is a noun.

The defeat badly affected the team’s morale.

The defeat had a bad effect on the team’s morale.



affinity

‘Affinity’ is followed by ‘with’ or ‘between’, not ‘to’ or ‘for’.



aggravate

‘Aggravate’ means ‘to make worse’, not ‘to annoy’.



aging



Also see

-ging vs -geing

Use ‘aging’, not ‘ageing’.



agreement

See collective nouns, dangling participles, gender (plural pronouns and possessives), he/she, him/her, his/hers, none, and plurals.

For useful guidance on the variations and complexities of this topic, see Peters on ‘agreement’.



albums (titles of)

Use title case and italics for the titles of long musical works like operas and symphonies and albums/collections of recorded music (eg, CDs). For more information, see italics (titles) and capitals (titles).



Alexander Turnbull Library credits

See captions and credits.



alignment (text)

As a general rule, align body text and headings to the left with a ragged right. Don’t centre the text.



Allies, Allied forces





all right

Spelling ‘all right’ as ‘alright’ is not all right. Don’t do it – all right?!



all together vs altogether

See altogether vs all together.



alternative

‘Alternative’ is now well established as a synonym for ‘choice’ or ‘option’.



altogether vs all together

‘Altogether’ means completely or on the whole. ‘All together’ means all in one place or all at once.

All together now, one, two, three …

Altogether the day was a disaster.



am and pm



Also see

abbreviations

numbers

times

These are abbreviations for ante meridiem (before midday) and post meridiem (after midday).

Don’t use full stops. Close up after the numerals.

10am, 8.30pm

NOTE: Te Papa uses the 12-hour rather than the 24-hour clock, apart from in schedules for international tour operators. 12am is midnight, 12pm is noon. To avoid ambiguity in events marketing copy, use ‘12 noon’ (note the space) or ‘midday’ rather than ‘12pm’.



among and amongst

Use ‘among’, not ‘amongst’. ‘Amongst’ may be relatively common in speech (like ‘whilst’), but we need to write with speakers of English as a second language in mind.



amount vs number



Also see

fewer vs less

Use ‘amount’ for quantities that can’t be counted but that can be measured. Use ‘number’ for things that can be counted.

amount of salt

number of people



ampersand (&)

Avoid using ‘&’, except where space is limited (eg, in web text or tables) or when part of a proper name. Use ‘and’ instead.



anachronisms



Also see

quotations

In historical texts, use the job titles, currencies, and so on used at the time.

Measurements

For measurements, use imperial units with metric equivalents in parentheses (use square brackets for interpolations in quotes) where their use fits the context, eg, quotes.

‘I used to walk 6 miles [10 kilometres] to school – there and back.’

Don’t do this for general references to measurement – stick with the metric.

The troop was some 20 kilometres away from the garrison at the time.



ancestors

Ancestors precede descendants.



any more

Use ‘any more’, not ‘anymore’.



Anzac



Also see

acronyms

This acronym (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) from World War I is sometimes confused with an initialism and written in full caps (ANZAC). However, Te Papa style is to capitalise only the first letter of the word. This is consistent with the RSA’s preference (rsa.org.nz/remem/award.htm).



Anzus Treaty

This is the proper name – sometimes also described as the ‘Anzus alliance’ (descriptive).



Aotearoa New Zealand

While ‘Aotearoa New Zealand’ is not the country’s official name, Te Papa often uses it in exhibitions and other text, in acknowledgement of this country's settlement history and biculturalism. Consider the context.

In the object label artist/maker line, however, use only ‘New Zealand’ for the country of affiliation. (In Māori exhibitions, the focus is on the iwi – including ‘New Zealand’ is often unnecessary.)



apostrophes



Also see

its vs it’s

Contractions

Use the apostrophe to indicate contractions (missing letters) of two words.

it’s (it is), doesn’t (does not), would’ve (would have), he’d (he had), she’s (she is or she has)

Possessives

Use the possessive apostrophe to indicate that something belongs to someone or something.

(i) Singular nouns

A singular noun is followed by -’s.

a moa’s beak, Bridget’s books

(ii) Plural nouns

A plural noun without the -s form has the same pattern as a singular noun.

children’s caregivers, sheep’s heads

A plural noun ending in -s is followed by the apostrophe.

the teachers’ applications, the houses’ frontage

(iii) Compound possessive phrases

A compound possessive phrase that is a single entity or has the sense of a unit takes -’s after the last word.

my sister-in-law’s opinion, Mum and Dad’s place, Tom and Jerry’s antics

However, where there is a sense of differentiated possession, add -’s to each element.

Mum’s and Dad’s first names, women’s and men’s health

(iv) Names ending in -s

Add an apostrophe after the s to indicate possession (not another s).

James’ mistake, the Williams’ second house, Frances Hodgkins’ paintings, Albert Camus’ novels

(v) Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns (ours, yours, theirs, his, hers, its) and possessive adjectives do not carry apostrophes.

The horse flicked its tail.

What’s yours is ours not theirs.

Compare ‘its’ (possessive, no apostrophe) with ‘it’s’ (meaning ‘it is’ or ‘it has’).

It’s a pity that its saddle got ruined. But never mind, it’s still been a very good day.

(vi) Parenthetical phrases

Avoid mixing a possessive with a parenthetical phrase.

Not It was James, her brother’s, car.

Say It was her brother James’ car

or It was the car of her brother James

or The car belonged to her brother James.

Plurals

In general, don’t use the apostrophe to indicate plurals.

keeping up with the Joneses not the Jones’

However, you can use apostrophes sparingly to form plurals of lower-case words or letters that normally don’t form plurals. Do this only if the apostrophe helps to read the words.

do’s and don’ts

p’s and q’s

Never use apostrophes to form plurals of upper-case abbreviations and dates.

CDs not CD’s

1970s not 1970’s

Exhibition text

(i) Contractions

By all means use contractions (eg, it’s, can’t, doesn’t) to give a conversational tone to exhibition text.

(ii) Possessives

Avoid using the possessive apostrophe with long words or names where the phrasing looks or sounds awkward.

the shoes of Pastor Philippoussis not Pastor Philippoussis’ shoes



app

Use lower case when referring to mobile apps (application software written for mobile devices). The abbreviation is acceptable as it’s the most common way to refer to this software.

App Store has initial capitals because it is a proper name.



appendix, appendices

Note that ‘appendices’ is the plural form of ‘appendix’.

To list an appendix, use a capital letter, not a number.

Appendix A not Appendix 1



archaeology vs archeology

Te Papa uses ‘archaeology’.



Armistice, the





art movements

Use lower case for most art movements. Note that the dictionary can be inconsistent in its use of capitals for art movements, so go with the lower-case rule here.

art deco, art nouveau, cubism, expressionism, fauve, impressionism, modernism, surrealism

Use initial capitals for proper names ...

Bauhaus, pre-Raphaelite

… or to differentiate what might otherwise be an ambiguous reference.

Arts and Crafts movement, Romantic period, Purism (which has different meaning with a lower-case p)



artefact

Use ‘artefact’, not ‘artifact’.



Article 1, Article 2, Article 3

Use an initial capital and numerals for the articles of the Treaty of Waitangi.



artists’ names

After the first mention of an artist’s full name in an exhibition label, generally use just the surname (not the first name). Make sure you use the full name first in each new label (since labels need to be as self-contained as possible). 

In more informal contexts (eg, marketing, an artist’s first name may be more appropriate. This may also be the case in some exhibitions, depending on the desired tone. Consistency is key, particularly for male and female artists.



artwork



Also see

italics

‘Artwork’ is the term for a graphic-design output or work produced by artists. ‘Art work’ is a piece of art.

artwork by Closet Studio

All art works for sale



art works (series or portfolios of)

The name of a series or portfolio of art works is given in Roman and title case in single quotation marks.

Point Jerningham at Night, from the series ‘Wellington Heads’

Use this style also in object label title lines.



at vs in

Take care with the use of these prepositions, noting the difference between being ‘in’ and ‘at’ places. 

at Oriental Bay beach in Wellington



audio guide

Use ‘audio guide’ (two words) not ‘audioguide’.



audiovisual

‘Audiovisual’ is one word not two, both as a noun and as an adjective. Do not use the abbreviation AV in running texts.



audiovisual screening descriptor



Also see

numbers (units of measurement)

captions and credits

Place the audiovisual screening time after the label heading and teaser text but before the credits. Use numerals.

New Zealand dinosaur discoveries

Journey back in time …

2:45

Note that we used to say ‘Runs for 2 minutes 45 seconds’ but because this equates to a lot of text when presented bilingually, we’ve shortened the style to what is common online. You may also need to add ‘screens continuously’ (or appropriate information).



aute

paper mulberry tree



autumn

This is lower case. See seasons.



AV

See audiovisual.



awards and qualifications

Use initial capitals when the qualification name is written in full.

She studied for her Bachelor of Science at Victoria University.

When abbreviating awards and qualifications, use capitals (with lower-case letters where necessary), closed up and with no full stops.

ballets (titles of)

Use title case and italics for the titles of ballets. For more information, see italics (titles) and capitals (italics).



BC and AD

See AD and BC.



BCE and CE



Also see

AD and BC

These are abbreviations for ‘before the Common Era’ and ‘Common Era’. They are secular versions of BC (before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini), with the same reference point.

Place both abbreviations after the date, with a space. Use capitals rather than small capitals, as sometimes prescribed. Don’t place commas in the dates.

2000 BCE, 1200 CE, 5th century CE

NOTE: In some contexts and for some audiences, saying ‘3,000 years ago’ may be more appropriate than saying ‘1000 BCE’ or ‘1000 BC’. (Notice the comma in ‘3,000 years ago’ but not 1000 BCE – this is correct.)



between/and (with numbers)

See dashes.



biannual vs biennial

‘Biannual’ means twice a year. ‘Biennial’ means every second year, thus the ‘Sydney Biennale’.



biased

Use ‘biased’, not ‘biassed’.



Bible references

See scriptures and sacred writings.



Bible, the

See scriptures and sacred writings.



bibliographic references

See bibliographies and capitals (titles).



bibliographies

Use the following style for bibliographies or lists of references.

i) Publication: Author’s surname, initials. Title. Place: publisher, year

Callaghan, P, and Hill, K. As Far as We Know. Auckland: Penguin Books, 2007

ii) Periodical: Author’s surname, initials. ‘Title’. Periodical name vol (no): xx [page no/s]

Holmes, B. ‘Flight of the Navigators’. New Scientist 199 (2666): 36–39

iii) Part of a multi-author publication: Author’s surname, initials. ‘Title’. In Title, ed [editor’s name]. Place: publisher, year

biennial vs biannual

See biannual vs biennial.



biological names



See scientific names.



Boer War

See South African War.



bold text



Also see

emphasis

italics

underlining

You can use bold text sparingly for emphasis. Don’t overuse it or the text becomes messy and hard to read.

NOTE: Be particularly careful when writing for the web, where bold text can indicate links rather than emphasis (although the norm is to underline links).



book titles

Use title case and italics for the titles of books and other published works. For more information, see capitals (titles) and italics (titles). 



bought vs brought

‘Bought’ is the past tense of ‘buy’. ‘Brought’ is the past tense of ‘bring’.

I have brought you the books that I bought yesterday.



brands

See trademarks, brands, and proprietary names.



Britain, British Isles

Britain’ is the common name for the ‘United Kingdom’ (in full, the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’; after the first mention UK) and is Te Papa’s preference. Be careful with your use of these words in these post-devolutionary times. Britain/the UK incorporates four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, issues around devolution and independence continue to be debated. Also, Britain does not include Éire (Ireland).

‘British Isles’ refers to the relevant group of islands that Britain holds. This term should be avoided because Éire (Ireland) is not part of Britain.

When in doubt, check with a curator, eg, Michael Fitzgerald.



British Empire, the

After the first reference, say ‘the empire’ (lower case).



British War Medal





Britten motorbike

Britten V1000



brought vs bought

See bought vs brought.



bullet points

Usage

Where appropriate, use bulleted lists to break up text – but don’t overuse them to the point of destroying the flow. Try to keep the lists to a maximum of seven or eight elements.

Bullet points can be particularly useful for web writing because readers often scan for specific information.

In exhibition writing (which usually prioritises ‘storytelling’), use bullet points where the context and communication objective call for them (eg, when a list of scientific facts need to be conveyed).

Punctuation

There are three types of bulleted lists.

(i) The bullet points follow an introductory statement and complete that sentence.

This type of list:

has a colon at the end of the introductory statement
starts each bullet point with a lower-case letter
has no punctuation at the end of each bullet point
ends with a full stop.
(ii) The bullet points are full sentences independent of the introductory statement.

Each bullet point is a complete sentence.
Each bullet point has an initial capital.
Each bullet point ends in a full stop.

(iii) The bullet points are not complete sentences and don’t follow an introductory statement.

Initial capital
No punctuation at end of bullet point
No final full stop

Align first-level bullet points left, with the text indented. Align second-level bullet points (the dashes) with the text of the first-level bullet points.



cafe

‘Cafe’, as in the food and beverage shop that sells coffee, is now a fully anglicised word and does not need an accented é. Amend your autocorrect (Tools/AutoCorrect Options).



campus, campuses

‘Campuses’ is the plural of ‘campus’.



capitals

acronyms

awards and qualifications

compass points and terms

government

headings and heading cases

italics

place names

quotation marks

speech punctuation

Rules for the use of capital letters are difficult to apply consistently. As with other style conventions, the trend is towards using fewer capitals. However, the matter is complicated by being bound up in ideas of status.

Generally speaking, Te Papa style is towards the minimal end of the spectrum, particularly in exhibition and related text.

Te Papa

As an institution, the museum uses capitals to distinguish:

its constituent parts from its activities
the titles of positions from types of work
names of parts of the building, like Wellington Foyer, Level 4, X-ray Room, and so on.
See Appendix A – Te Papa names for a comprehensive list of names at Te Papa.

Proper nouns (proper names)

Use initial capitals for proper nouns (nouns representing specific entities) to distinguish them from generic or common nouns (nouns describing a class of entities). Proper nouns include (but are not limited to) the types of name below.

NOTE: Some nouns operate as proper nouns as well as common nouns.

(i) People

Aloysius Enderby

Use initial capitals for ‘Dad’, ‘Mum’, ‘Nana’, etc if treating these words as proper nouns. If a possessive pronoun (eg, ‘my’ or ‘your’) comes before the word, then use lower case.

‘Come here, Dad!’

My mum grew up on a farm.

(ii) Places (including geographical features, regions, and the built environment)

Wellington, Waikato River, Auckland Harbour Bridge, Parliament House, the Far North, the West Coast (South Island), Volcanic Plateau, Desert Road, Ninety Mile Beach

NOTE: Compass points can be part of a proper noun or merely descriptive, as ‘eastern’ is in the second example below.

Southern Alps but eastern Pacific

(iii) Organisations

Use initial capitals when writing an organisation’s name in full.

Inland Revenue Department, Victoria University

After the first mention, you can drop the capitals when not referring to the organisation in full.

the New Zealand Government > the government

the National Government > the government

the British Empire > the empire

The Lighting Company > the company

the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary > the sanctuary

The exception is when there is room for confusion.

The Historical Society > the Society

(iv) Titles/positions

Use initial capitals when writing a person’s title or position in full.

Prime Minister Helen Clark, Director of Experience Joe Kapa

After the first mention, you can drop the capitals when not referring to the title in full.

Prime Minister Helen Clark > the prime minister

Chief Executive Officer Margaret Smith > the chief executive [FW1] 

Te Papa makes an exception for Kings/Queens, Kīngi/Kuini, and other leaders of very high status, where readers aren’t used to seeing the lower-case version.

Queen Elizabeth II > the Queen

Don’t use initial capitals for position titles when referring to them in a generic sense. Also see position titles

The professors punished their students.

A chief executive officer should have a good sense of humour.

(v) Trademarks, brands, and proprietary names

Follow the capitalisation used by the proprietors. Don’t use the ® and ™ symbols – there is no legal need to (advice from our Rights Manager Victoria Leachman).

adidas, Mountain Buggy, Nutella, LYCRA, Blu Tack

(vi) Historical periods and events

the Enlightenment, World War II

(vii) Nationalities, ethnicities, tribal groups

French, Māori, Pākehā, Ngāti Porou

Mixed proper nouns (capital and lower case)

Use capitals for the proper name, lower case for the common noun.

King Charles spaniel, Adélie penguin, Hutton’s shearwater

Academic subjects and qualifications

Don’t use initial capitals for academic subjects (except when the subjects are proper nouns like ‘English’) or for words descriptive of qualifications.

I was really good at geography at high school.

He did his doctorate at Cambridge.

She studied science at Victoria University.

Use capitals (with lower-case letters where necessary) when referring to a qualification in abbreviated form.

BA in Anthropology, PhD, BSc

Also use capitals when writing the names of degree courses, national exams, and trade certificates in full.

University Entrance, National Certificate in First Line Management

She was awarded her Bachelor of Science.

Titles of books and other published works

Use title case (and italics) for the titles of books and other published works, including newspapers and other periodicals, plays, films, radio and television series, collections of recorded music (eg, CDs), and DVDs. Using the title case means using initial capitals for all words except articles (unless the article is part of the proper name, eg, The Dominion Post), conjunctions, and prepositions.

Articles include: a, an, the.
Conjunctions include: and, but, for, or, than.
Prepositions include: at, between, by, during, for, from, in, on, over, through, under, with.
Be careful because personal pronouns (eg, ‘my’, ‘me’, and ‘your’) do take an initial capital. You can’t just go by the length of the word.

Look under the Leaves not Look Under the Leaves

Dance with Me not Dance With me

Welcome to My Home not Welcome to my Home

(i) Hyphenated words

Where a hyphenated word appears in a title, don’t capitalise the second element of the word, unless the first element is a prefix, as in the second example below.

‘Right-wing Parties in New Zealand Politics’

‘Dealing with Pre-Adolescent Kids’[f2] 

See headings and heading cases for information on capitalising titles of parts of exhibitions, chapter or section titles, and other headings in Te Papa publications.

Exhibition names and taglines

Use title case (and italics) for exhibition names.

Awesome Forces, Nga Toi │Arts Te Papa

Use sentence case for exhibition taglines. When running on the exhibition name and tagline, separate the two with a colon.

Precious Metals: New Zealand design in gold and silver

For exhibitions that have two equivalent names (rather than a title and tagline), use title case for both.

Whales │Tohorā

Legislation

Use title case for titles of legislation. After the first mention, you can drop the capitals when not referring to the legislation in full.

Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 > the act

Acronyms and abbreviations

Distinguish between acronyms (groups of letters that are pronounced as a single word) and initialisms (groups of letters that are sounded out separately).

For acronyms, generally use an initial capital followed by lower-case letters, especially if the acronym is an organisational name.
Anzus, Anzac, Unesco, Unicef, Nato, Eftpos, Aids

but note awol (absent without leave)

For initialisms, generally use full capitals, even when the original words are lower case.
UN, TAB, GST, TVNZ, EQC

PM (prime minister), MP (member of Parliament)

Exceptions to the capitalisation rule include am (ante meridiem) and eg (exempli gratia).
Also use full capitals for initials in names, plus some other abbreviations (eg, compass points). Note that some abbreviations are now accepted as words (eg, scuba, laser).
J K Rowling

NNW

Also see abbreviations and acronyms

Quotes

Use a capital for the first word of a quote if that quote is a full sentence but not if it is simply an extract (unless the first word is a proper noun).

Mr Hakiwai said, ‘The museum has had a tremendous year.’

Mr Hakiwai said that the museum’s year had been ‘tremendous’.

Also see speech punctuation

For guidance on capitalisation of specific words, see the Concise Oxford Dictionary.



Captain Cook

See Cook, James.



captions and credits



Also see

object labels

props, prop descriptors

A caption is a description of an image. A credit is an acknowledgement of its maker, source, or copyright owner, or all three. The formats for different contexts are covered below.

NOTE: If a photograph in an exhibition is a collection item rather than a graphic, it has an object label (OL) rather than a caption/credit. See object labels.

Interdisciplinary exhibitions
Marketing text
Art exhibitions and art marketing
Creative Commons credits
ATL and Archives NZ registration numbers in credits
Audiovisual credits
Music credits and sound effects


1. INTERDISCIPLINARY EXHIBITIONS

The credit can run on from the caption or be on a new line, depending on the exhibition design (often affected by space). Use a consistent layout throughout the exhibition.

(1.i) Exhibitions – photographs NOT of collection items (ie, most exhibition graphics)

In captions, use the simple present (Joe raises the flag) rather than present continuous (Joe raising the flag).
If the image is a detail, say ‘(detail)’ after the date.
If the creator of the image is also the permission giver, say ‘Photograph by and courtesy of’.
Use ‘Photographer unknown’ or ‘date unknown’ if relevant.
Where a book is involved, just give the author and date of publishing – don’t list the publishing house.
If the image is Te Papa’s, write ‘Te Papa’ after the photographer details, preceded by a full stop.

5. ATL AND ARCHIVES NZ REGISTRATION NUMBERS IN CREDITS

(5.i) Alexander Turnbull Library registration numbers in credits

Some Alexander Turnbull Library registration numbers appear in two formats: fraction-number-letter or letter-number-fraction. Use the first form – only this one will work in Timeframes (ATL’s online database).

1/2-029512-F not F-29512-1/2

If the code you receive has the fraction last, swap the order. You may need to add a zero before the middle number – it needs to be six digits long to retrieve the image online.

Leave image codes that don’t follow this format as they are, eg: FC1-q-255-24-1.

(5.ii) Archives New Zealand registration numbers in credits

Images from Archives New Zealand can have two numbers – an Archives one and an Alexander Turnbull Library one. If they do, reduce ‘Alexander Turnbull Library’ to ‘ATL’ and list their number after the Archives one, with a semicolon between.

All Archives New Zealand still images should include ‘Wellington Office’ in the credit.

6. AUDIOVISUAL CREDITS

There are many variables for AV credits – seek guidance from the digital producers. 

(6.i) Credits for videos – at the end of videos

Use this format for copyright:

© Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa 2015

When acknowledging others, keep it simple:

Te Papa thanks Dame Margaret Sparrow

Te Papa thanks The Video Factory for extracts from Britten: Backyard Visionary

The exception is when specific wording was requested by a partner/provider/contributor:

Developed by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa working closely with Weta Workshop

For credits in videos of art works, photographs, etc, use the relevant styles in Interdisciplinary exhibitions or Art exhibitions and art marketing, under Captions and credits.

(6.ii) Credits for videos and still images from videos – in web and exhibition text

Use the style of the credits within the video, but add ‘All rights reserved’/‘Some rights reserved’ for videos and sound clips on web pages (eg, Te Papa Channel, YouTube) to make it immediately clear that copyright exists.

This video has all rights reserved. Te Papa

Sometimes specific wording is requested by a partner/provider/contributor.

7. MUSIC CREDITS AND SOUND EFFECTS

(7.i) Music credits

There are many variables for music credits – seek guidance from the digital producers.

Generally, a music credit needs: composer/title of the work/performer/date of performance/rights holder.

Depending on context and type of music, it might also need date of composition/ performance location/album/ publisher/soloist/recorded by/engineered by/mixed by.  

Igor Stravinsky, The Firebird, 1910, performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Pietari Inkinen, at the Michael Fowler Centre, Wellington, 14 April 2012. Recorded by Radio New Zealand

Excerpt from Rikki Gooch and the Sound Institute, Walk – A Response. Performed and recorded live on 23 February 2014, as part of the ‘Walk with Me: McCahon’ series of events at Te Papa

(7.ii) Sound effects

These are generally kept simple and descriptive.

chapter titles

Set chapter titles in title case and roman text (not italics) inside single quotation marks. See quotation marks (titles).



circa

In exhibition and website text, use ‘about’ not ‘circa’ for dates. (Interestingly, visitor market research by Oakland Museum indicated that one of the most commonly asked questions was ‘What does c/circa mean?’ There is no need to put this barrier before audiences when they are faced with so many other more important ideas and experiences.) 



clauses

See commas (introductory clauses and phrases, non-defining clauses and phrases) and sentences (sentence structure).



clear English

See plain English.



collectable

Use ‘collectable’, not ‘collectible’.

Collections Online URL

The correct URL (web address) for Collections Online is tepapa.govt.nz/collections
not
collections.tepapa.govt.nz

Notice that we no longer using www beforehand.



collective nouns



Also see

plurals

Nouns like ‘committee’, ‘family’, and ‘team’ take a singular verb or pronoun when thought of as a unit.

The committee prides itself on its independence.

The family has a bach in Ohope.

The hockey team was eventually victorious, winning gold at the Olympic Games.

They take a plural verb or pronoun when thought of as a collection of individuals.

The staff have enjoyed their outings to the salsa club.

The team are all multitalented.

Whichever you choose, singular or plural, check your consistency throughout the text.



colloquial language

Take care with your treasured gems of colloquial language in exhibition and website writing. Remember the many visitors who don’t have English as their first language. What would they make of this?

Oodles of Kiwis dash across the ditch each year for a quick gander at the Lucky Country.

USG

colons and semicolons



Also see

dashes (sentences)

Colons

Use colons to indicate that something else follows the main clause: a more detailed explanation, a list, or a quote.

I chose three colours: red, green, and yellow.

In any heading – sentence case or title case – that includes a colon, use an initial capital on the word directly after the colon. 

Remember Me: A Biography of Martha Brown

Semicolons

Use semicolons to separate parts of a complex list where the list items already include commas.

The speakers include Ranginui Brown, Head of Māori at Wanganui College; Peter Holloway, Associate Professor of Geography at Victoria University; and Arapata Hakiwai, Kaihautū (Māori Leader) at Te Papa.

Semicolons are also used to connect clauses that are related but independent. However, avoid using them like this in exhibition text, and question the need for them in other contexts, where they can add a sense of formality. Preferably use a full stop or an en dash instead.



commas



Also see

dangling participles

introductory clauses and phrases

numbers (commas)

speech punctuation

that vs which

Commas aid readability, especially in exhibition and website text, making easily grasped chunks of sense for readers on the move. This is not a licence to write long, comma-ridden sentences for labels.

Serial comma (Oxford comma)

Use the serial comma, otherwise known as the Oxford comma. This is the comma before the final ‘and’ in a list of three or more things.

men, women, and children

He grew up in Gore, went to university in Auckland, then moved to Taihape.

Introductory clauses and phrases

Use commas after introductory clauses and phrases. They are particularly important when two words coming together could cause confusion. Compare these examples.

After the warning signs were installed at the top of the cliff.

After the warning, signs were installed at the top of the cliff.

One-word introductory phrases (eg, soon, now, sometimes, suddenly) are often OK without the comma.

Note that if the adverbial phrase is placed after the main clause, the comma isn’t necessary. Compare these examples.

In 1991, she moved back to New Zealand.

She moved back to New Zealand in 1991.

In exhibition and website writing, avoid long or complicated introductory clauses and phrases. Readers on the move have little patience for puzzling out these kinds of inversion. They need the subject as soon as possible.

Not As well as being a renowned painter, printmaker, and potter, John Moore was an accomplished dancer.

but John Moore was an accomplished dancer, as well as a renowned painter, printmaker, and potter. 

or John Moore was a renowned painter, printmaker, and potter – and he was also an accomplished dancer.

Non-defining clauses and phrases

Non-defining clauses and phrases convey information that could be omitted without affecting the sense of the sentence. A defining clause or phrase conveys essential information and can’t be omitted.

With non-defining clauses and phrases, place the commas before and after the non-defining element, not just before.

The car, which I’ve had since I got married, broke down again yesterday.

(i) Names

Compare the uses of commas in the following sentences.

My father, John, was a difficult man.

Photographer Duncan Monro has won many awards.

In the first sentence, the name inside the commas, ‘John’, could be omitted and the sentence would still make sense. It is non-defining. The name ‘Duncan Monro’ couldn’t be omitted from the sentence. It is defining.

Another way to think about this is that there is only one father to the writer = commas. However, there is more than one photographer in the world, so the name is essential to the sentence = no commas.

NOTE: Be careful with sentences like the following.

Adrienne’s colleague James didn’t agree.

Because James is not Adrienne’s only colleague, and it is therefore necessary to specify his name, this sentence does not need commas. Compare with the earlier example ‘My father, John, was a difficult man.’

Also see that vs which

Compound sentences

Generally use a comma before the conjunctions ‘and’, ‘but’, and ‘or’ in compound sentences.

Frith is a writer, and Emily is a designer.

When the subject doesn’t change or isn’t repeated, omit the comma.

Te Ikanui raised his glass and addressed the group.

I’m tired but happy.

When the subject doesn’t change but is repeated, usually include the comma. Compare the following sentences to the ones above.

Te Ikanui raised his glass, and then he looked around the group.

I’m tired, but I’m happy too.

Between verb and subject

DO NOT use a comma between a verb and its subject. People sometimes mistakenly do this when the subject is a long one (a subject group). 

Those who supported the new chief executive stood up and applauded loudly.

not

Those who supported the new chief executive, stood up and applauded loudly.

TIP: Try replacing the subject group with a simple subject and then see if using the comma makes sense.

Bartholomew stood up and applauded loudly. 

Adjectives

Use commas to separate two or more adjectives before a noun.

Liz is a loyal, loving, and devoted mother.

You can leave the commas out if the adjectives (usually not more than two) regularly appear together in a time-honoured way.

TIP: Would the phrase sound right if you (a) changed the order of the adjectives or (b) put ‘and’ between them (or both)? If not, don’t add commas.

An ugly little dog sat in the corner.

Direct addresses

Use a comma before a person’s name in a direct address to them.

‘Check this out, Desmond!’

Direct quotes (speech)

Use a comma before a direct quote.

James yelled, ‘Stop! Don’t do it! Don’t put that comma there!’

Also see speech punctuation

Definitions (glosses)

Use a comma before ‘or’ when ‘or’ indicates a definition. If the text continues after the definition, you may need to use another comma to set off the sub-clause. (See ‘Non-defining clauses’ above.)

This blade is made from pounamu, or New Zealand greenstone.

Pounamu, or New Zealand greenstone, is a prized material.

Numbers

Always use a comma before the final three figures in thousands (and higher numbers). Don’t use spaces.

4,000 not 4000

US$1,000 not US$1000

12,000 people not 12000 people or 12 000 people

Also see numbers (commas)

Too

Don’t use a comma before ‘too’ in sentences like that below.

The cops came too not The cops came, too.

NOTE: Although this comma does appear in many publications, there is little justification for its use. You wouldn’t use a comma if you replaced ‘too’ with ‘as well’ or ‘also’, and there is no natural pause in these sentences either.



Commonwealth, the

Use an initial capital for ‘Commonwealth’ when referring to the international association of states that used to be part of the British Empire.



compare to vs compare with

The distinction between ‘comparing to’ and ‘comparing with’ is becoming increasingly vague. The traditional distinction is as follows: to compare something ‘to’ something means to liken the things – to draw attention to their similarities. To compare something ‘with’ something means to consider their similarities and differences.



compass points and terms



Also see

abbreviations

symbols

Use lower case when spelling out compass terms. The compounds are hyphenated.

south-east, north-western Auckland, the south of the South Island, northern Taranaki

Capitalise when the compass terms form part of a regional or cultural identity.

The Far North, Southeast Asia, East Coast iwi, the Western world

Capitalise the symbols.

E, SW, NNW



complement vs compliment

‘To complement’ means ‘to add features to’ or ‘to go well with’. ‘To compliment’ means ‘to praise or admire’.



compound adjectives

See adverbs that qualify adjectives.



comprise

‘To comprise’ means ‘to consist of’, or ‘include’. Therefore, ’comprise of’ is redundant.

The work comprises metal shavings, wood chips, and used chewing gum.

not

The work is comprised of metal shavings, wood chips, and used chewing gum.



confusions (common)

See affect vs effect, amount vs number, biannual vs biennial, bought vs brought, complement vs compliment, discreet vs discrete, disc vs disk, disinterested vs uninterested, fewer vs less, its vs it’s etc.



contractions



Also see

abbreviations

apostrophes

Contractions are abbreviations that retain the first and last letters of a word. Don’t use full stops. 

Mr (Mister), Dr (Doctor), Mt (Mount), Ltd (Limited), dept (department)

Contractions are also formed when two words are combined but letters are missed out. Use the apostrophe to indicate the missing letters.

it’s (it is), doesn’t (does not), would’ve (would have), he’d (he had), she’s (she is or she has)

You can use such contractions to give a conversational tone to exhibition text.



Cook Islands

Include the ‘s’ when using ‘Cook Islands’ as an adjective.

Cook Islands culture not Cook Island culture

Preferably use ‘Cook Islands people’ to ’Cook Islanders’ to describe the inhabitants. Note the specific communities, such as Rarotonga (capital Avarua) and Mangaia.



Cook Islands Māori

Note macron.

Cook Islands Maori

Cook, James

Be careful about what title you give this noted British explorer. He was a lieutenant when he first visited New Zealand and a commander on his second voyage. He was not promoted to captain until 1775, at the end of his second voyage.

‘British explorer James Cook’ is the safe option in all instances.



coordinate, coordinator, coordination vs co‑ordinate, co‑ordinator, co‑ordination

Te Papa does not use hyphens in these words. 



Copyright

Also see

captions and credits

When using the copyright symbol in credits[VC9] , you don’t need to include the word ‘copyright’ before.

© Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa 2014
not
copyright © Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa 2014



cords vs chords

‘Cords’ are what you use to vocalise or tie in knots. ‘Chords’ are several tones sounding concurrently.



country and region names



Also see

capitals

place names

Don’t abbreviate country and region names. Spell them out in full, except when referring to currency or where space is limited (eg, in a table).

New Zealand not NZ

Australia not Aus

Southeast Asia not SE Asia

Exceptions include countries where the abbreviation is a widely known acronym.

United States (first mention) > the US



Creative Commons credits

See captions and credits.



credit punctuation

See captions and credits.



criterion, criteria

Note that the singular form of ‘criteria’ is ‘criterion’.



Crown, the

Use a capital when referring to the British monarchy.



cultivated species

Names for breeds of animals and cultivars of plants (as distinct from their scientific names) are capitalised.

Perendale sheep, Cordyline ‘Bronze Beauty’, Agria potato, Roma tomato



dad vs Dad

See capitals (proper nouns).



dangling participles

Make sure that the subject of a sentence’s main clause agrees with any preceding phrases and clauses. (‘Dangling participle’ refers to the verbal form that is left without a proper subject agreement – these inverted elements often begin with a participle.)

Not Never before seen in New Zealand, Te Papa is proud to feature Bill Culbert’s Drop …

but Never before seen in New Zealand, Bill Culbert’s Drop features in Te Papa’s next …

Not Born during a period of war, the composer’s work reflects the violence of that time.

but Born during a period of war, the composer reflects the violence of that time in her work.

Not Having made a big effort, his disappointment was even more intense.

but Having made a big effort, he was even more intensely disappointed.

Having got your head around this, avoid these types of inverted construction in exhibition and web writing as moving and scanning readers need the subject quickly.



dashes



Also see

colons and semicolons

parentheses

Numbers and dates

Use unspaced en dashes (not hyphens) between numbers, including dates.

pages 14–16 not pages 14-16

1980–90 not 1980-90

1999–2008 not 1999-2008

26–27 November 2011

The en dash should be spaced when it separates different elements in a date range (eg, year and day, as below).

1 May 2011 – 5 June 2011

Never use an en dash with words like ‘between’, ‘from’, and ‘during’.

between 9am and 10am not between 9am–10am

from 1915 to 1920 not from 1915–1920

Proper nouns (proper names)

Use unspaced en dashes between proper nouns of equal value.

New Zealand–Australia relations

Sentences

Use spaced en dashes (not hyphens or em dashes) to separate sentence elements.

At first I thought she was laughing – but then I noticed the tears.

You can use the en dash for different reasons, for example:

to indicate a break in thought or abrupt change (as in the example above)
before a list of examples (like a colon)
to act in the same way as parentheses (obviously, you’ll need to use two for this option)
to explain or amplify on the preceding statement
to show a pause for rhetorical effect
to add emphasis.
Don’t use the longer em dashes (—).

Titles

A colon is used in front of taglines. It’s better to avoid having two taglines, but if both are necessary, use a dash for the second one, as in this example of a video clip title from Te Papa Channel:

The World of Whales: What Lies Beneath – Science Express [VC10] 



dates



Also see

Māori time sequence

Use the following forms for dates.

Wednesday 6 September 2007 not Wednesday September 6 2007 and not Wednesday September 6th 2007

Wed 6 Sep 2007 not Wed Sep 6 2007 and not Wed Sep 6th 2007

1–5 May 2011

1 May 2011 – 5 June 2011 (the en dash is spaced here because it separates different elements)

1990s not 1990’s

1990s not 90s (although 90s is okay after the first mention or after 1980s)

1890–95 (because century 18 applies to both)

1625–1713 (new century)

1920s–30s

1890s–1920s

555–520 bc, 500–1250 ad

1800s (preference) or 19th century not nineteenth century

mid 1800s, late 1990s, in the early 15th century

Also see Māori time sequence

Decades

Avoid writing out the decades, except in phrases such as ‘the swinging sixties’. Use ‘the 1960s’ rather than ‘the 60s’ on first mention. You may shorten to ‘the 60s’ on subsequent mentions, but not if there is a mixture or centuries referred to in the text as a whole.

Centuries

Use the series number style for centuries, with figures for all. Don’t use superscript for ordinal endings – change your autocorrect (Tools/AutoCorrect Options/AutoFormat As You Type).

between the 1st and 10th centuries

19th century not 19th century

For general audiences, however, it is often preferable to use ‘1800s’ over ‘19th century’. This format avoids any mental calculation and is therefore easier to understand for readers on the move (as in exhibitions) and speakers of English as a second language.

Bear in mind, however, that ‘1800s’ used to refer exclusively to the first decade of the 19th century, so when you mean that first decade, say 'the first decade of the 1800s'. If confusion is likely on a general level (ie, you frequently move from talking about decades to centuries, or the audience is an older one), use the ‘19th century’ format throughout.

Approximate dates

For approximate dates (+/- 5 years), avoid using ‘circa’ for non-specialist audiences. Use ‘about’.

about 1850 not circa 1850

Between/and, from/to

Never use an en dash with words like ‘between’, ‘from’, and ‘during’.

from 1915 to 1920 not from 1915–1920

between 1999 and 2005 not between 1999–2005

Unknown date

Use a question mark for an unknown date.

See numbers (money).



Dominion Post

See The Dominion Post.



dot, dot, dot

See ellipses.



double quotation marks

See quotation marks.



drypoint

Te Papa Style is one word for this term – consistent with what is used internationally but different from the listing in the New Zealand Oxford.



due to, owing to

‘Due to’ and ‘owing to’ are interchangeable. However, Te Papa prefers the plain English ‘because of’. Some speakers of English as a second language struggle with the use of ‘due to’ and ‘owing to’ because ‘due’ and ‘owe’ have other meanings in other contexts.



e-newsletter

See e-words.



e-words

Use a hyphen after the prefix ‘e-’ when it means ‘electronic’. The exception is ‘email’.

e-commerce not ecommerce

e-learning not elearning

e-lert, e-newsletter



earth

Capitalise ‘Earth’ when referring to the planet.



east, eastern



Also see

compass points and terms

Capitalise East and Eastern in place names and when referring to regions or cultural or political entities.

the Eastern Pacific Rise; East Cape; the East versus the West; the Eastern bloc; East Asia

Use lower case for general geographic location.

eastern Southland; east of Eden



-ed vs -t endings

Te Papa prefers the -ed ending for the past simple and past participle forms of words such as burn (burned), dream (dreamed), kneel (kneeled), lean (leaned), learn (learned), smell (smelled), spell (spelled), spill (spilled), and spoil (spoiled).



effect

See affect vs effect.



eg



Also see

abbreviations

This is the abbreviation for ‘exempli gratia’ (given examples). Avoid using ‘eg’, except where space is limited (as in a table). Use ‘for example’ or ‘for instance’.

Place a comma before and after the abbreviation. Don’t use full stops or spaces. (These are going out of fashion with abbreviations generally.)

oceanic birds, eg, shearwater, petrel, and fulmar

Be careful not to confuse ‘eg’, which gives something as an example, with ‘ie’, which specifies something and can be replaced with ‘that is'.



elderly

Be cautious about applying this adjective to anyone younger than 75. Life expectancy and expectations of normal levels of activity are rising. ‘Seniors’ is another option.



ellipsis



Also see

quotations

Use three dots for an ellipsis.

In the middle of a sentence or quotation, place a single space on each side of the ellipsis.
At the end of a sentence, place a single space before the ellipsis and no full stop after.
Omissions in quotations

Use an ellipsis to indicate an omission in quotations, regardless of whether the omission comes in the middle of a sentence or between sentences. Retain the capital letter after the ellipsis if a sentence begins after an omission. It is also reasonable (except in a strict scholarly context) to capitalise the new beginning word if the resumed quotation makes a complete sentence.

Do not use an ellipsis at the end of a quote, even if you’re omitting part of a sentence, unless the material could be misconstrued without it.

‘Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s … ox … nor anything that is thy neighbour’s.’

Hesitation in speech

You can use an ellipsis to indicate a pause or hesitation in speech.

‘Ah … I think it’s … actually, I don’t know.’

‘Would you use … an ellipsis here … really?’ (No, you wouldn’t.)



em dashes

Don’t use em dashes – use en dashes instead. See dashes.



email



Also see

e-words

Email has now become an established unhyphenated word. Not so e-commerce, e-newsletter, e-lert (as at 2014).





emphasis (italics for)

You can use italics sparingly for emphasis. Because italics are harder to read than roman text, avoid widespread use, especially online and in exhibition text.



en dashes

See dashes.



en route

En route is a phrase borrowed from French meaning ‘on the way’. It’s never ‘on’ route.



enquire, enquiry vs inquire, inquiry

‘Enquire’ is to seek information (as in Te Papa’s Enquiry Centre). ‘Inquire’ is to investigate – an inquiry is a formal investigation.



ensure vs insure

‘Ensure’ is to make certain. ‘Insure’ is to guard against risk.



etc



Also see

abbreviations

This is the abbreviation for ‘et cetera’ (‘and the rest’) – now ‘etcetera’ when written in full. Don’t place a full stop after the final letter unless it falls at the end of a sentence. Use a comma before this abbreviation.

The joys of life: spring, sleep, etc.

Avoid using ‘etc’, except where space is limited (as in a table). Use ‘and so on’ or ‘and others’. That said, in exhibition text there should be no need to write such vague phrases.



European Economic Union (EEU)





Evening Post

See The Evening Post.



event names

Use title case (but not italics) for the names of events in marketing text, except for Discovery Centre activities and StoryPlace programmes, which take sentence case (because they tend to be long ‘calls to action’).

Italicise exhibition names when they appear as part of event names.

Food for Thought with Alison Holst

European Masters Floortalk

Assemble an astounding elephant mask [Discovery Centre]



every day vs everyday

‘Every day’ is two words when it is an adverbial phrase, one word when it is an adjective.

It happens every day – an everyday happening.



exhibition names, and names of parts of exhibitions



Also see

Appendix A – Te Papa names

Use italics and title case for the names of exhibitions in running text. If including the tagline, separate it from the main name with a colon. The tagline is in title case too (this style applies to all Renewal exhibitions and beyond – previously, taglines were in sentence case).

John Parker: Handmade Precision

For exhibitions that have two equivalent names (rather than a title and tagline), use title case for both.

Whales │Tohorā

When the exhibition name is a heading, don’t use italics, but when it’s part of an event name, do.

The Wow Factor [heading on its own]

The Wow Factor Floortalk [part of event name]

See the list of exhibition names in Appendix A – Te Papa names.

Parts of exhibitions

Use sentence case and quotation marks when referring to parts of an exhibition, ie, names of segments, sections, or activities.

‘Contemporary focus’, ‘Fish and trips’, ‘Get ready for the Big One’



Explore trolley

These trolleys, supervised by the Hosts, allow visitors to interact closely with items related to exhibitions.

Please note that they are not called ‘Touch trolleys’ but ‘Explore trolleys’.



facade

‘Facade’ is now a fully anglicised word and doesn’t need ç.



factoid

A ‘factoid’ is not a trivial fact but a mistaken assumption repeated so often that it is believed to be true.



faze vs phase

To ‘faze’ is to disconcert. A ‘phase‘ is a stage.



Feilding

This Manawatū town is not spelled Fielding.



fewer vs less



Also see amount vs number

Use ‘fewer’ (smaller in number) for things that can be counted. Use ‘less’ (smaller in quantity) for things that can’t be counted but that can be measured.

There were fewer visitors today.

Can I have a little less food next time please?



film-maker, film-making

Use hyphens in these words.



films (titles of)

Use title case and italics for the titles of films, videos, slideshows[VC12] , and other published works. For more information, see capitals (titles) and italics (titles).

Online video clip and slideshow titles are not italicised as there is no technical capacity to do this.



First Day Covers





first Labour Government (1939–45)

Don’t capitalise ‘first’, which is descriptive.



First World War

In exhibition text, don’t use ‘First World War’. Use ‘World War I’ – also the more common search phrase on the internet.

In web text, you may also want to incorporate ‘First World War’ and ‘World War 1’ because they are alternative key phrases.

Also see First World War Centenary



First World War Centenary

This is the official name of the centenary of World War I (2014–18), as per the MCH website, with the overall branding of ww100 (ww100.govt.nz).



fish hook

Two words. In this case, we differ from the New Zealand Oxford Dictionary, which lists fish-hook.



flaunt vs flout

To ‘flaunt’ is to make a display of something. To ‘flout’ is to show disregard, eg, for a law.



flier

See flyer.



floortalk

A special Te Papa compound word!



flounder vs founder

To ‘flounder’ is to perform a task badly. To ‘founder’ is to fail.

The exhibition foundered because the team members floundered.



flyer

Use ‘flyer’ rather than ‘flier’ for something airborne and the marketing device.



focus, focused, focuses, focusing

Use the single -s forms of these words, including for the plural noun ‘focuses’ (as opposed to ‘foci’).



folk tales, myths, and legends

If a specific publication is not being referred to, use title case but not italics, as each story is unique but does not have specific ownership.

Ina and the Shark[VC13] 



fonts

See legibility.



footnotes



Also see

bibliographies

references

Footnotes are rarely needed in exhibition text, usually only for source references and copyright requirements. They should never be used for essential information.

Avoid incorporating references or credits in running text.

Footnotes should not be used in web writing. Any references, sources, or copyright credits should be placed immediately by the material concerned.

Footnote references in exhibition text

Use symbols (*) not numerals as footnote references in exhibition text.

Bibliographic references in footnotes

Use the following styles for bibliographic references in footnotes.

i) Publication: Author, title (place: publisher, year) p/pp xx [if needed]

Paul Callaghan and Kim Hill, As Far as We Know (Auckland: Penguin Books, 2007)

ii) Periodical: Author, ‘title’, periodical name vol (no): xx [page no/s]

Bob Holmes, ‘Flight of the Navigators’, New Scientist 199 (2666): 36–39

iii) Part of a multi-author publication: Author, ‘title’, in publication title (place: publisher, year)

Sean Mallon and Uili Fecteau, ‘Tatatau-ed: Polynesian Tatau in Aotearoa’, in Pacific Art Niu Sila (Wellington: Te Papa Press, 2002)

abbreviations (eg, ie, etc, &, +)

Place a comma before and after ‘for example’ when you use the phrase in the middle of a sentence.

You would have oysters on special occasions, for example, on birthdays.

Place a comma after the phrase when it begins a sentence.

For example, never turn your back on the speaker.



foreign names

Surnames with French ‘le’ or ‘de’, Italian ‘di’, Dutch ‘van’, German ‘von’ etc are all lower case within full names. Capitalise them without first names – ie, both the following are correct.

Petrus van der Velden

Van der Velden



foreign words and phrases



Also see

glossing

English and Māori are official languages in New Zealand. There are many other community languages here that have been naturalised into English, and it would be objectionable to characterise them as foreign.

Never italicise Māori and Pacific language words or phrases, nor words in languages regarded as community languages. Simply include a gloss in parentheses directly after the word on its first mention. Gloss again every time the word or phrase appears separately, eg, in a new exhibition label or on a new web page.

In exhibition labels, regard the main heading, body text, and object information as separate for the purposes of glossing. Readers on the move may pause only momentarily by the label, and the gloss should be available in whatever part their eye alights on.

If you need to distinguish genuinely foreign words and phrases, use single quote marks. Make sure you give the words and phrases in their correct form, with their correct diacritics.

Some words like ‘schadenfreude’ (malicious enjoyment of another’s misfortunes) are used, but not so widely that they have been received into the language like ‘fait accompli’.



forever vs for ever

‘Forever’ is continually. ‘For ever’ is for evermore.

She is forever talking about food.

I will remember this day for ever.



formula, formulas, formulae

The plural of ‘formula’ is ‘formulas’ in general use; ‘formulae’ in maths or science use.



fortuitous vs fortunate

‘Fortuitous’ is by chance or accident. ‘Fortunate’ is by good fortune, lucky.



fractions

See numbers (fractions).



freshwater

‘Freshwater’ as an adjective is one word (freshwater fish); but ‘fish found in fresh water’.



from/to (with numbers)

See dashes.



fulfil, fulfilling, fulfilled, fulfilment

Te Papa goes with the single -l spelling, apart from the participles (fulfilling, fulfilled).



full stops



Also see

abbreviations

bullet points

hashtags

parentheses

quotation marks

website and email addresses

Use full stops at the ends of complete sentences (sentences with a subject, verb, and object).

Don’t use a full stop for sentences, whether complete or incomplete, in captions or display or instructional-type text.

Michael on horseback, 2008

Latecomers not admitted

Screens every 20 minutes

Strobe lighting may affect some viewers

Push the button to play the video

If you have a list that combines complete and incomplete sentences, choose one style and apply it to all elements for consistency.



gender

Use of language reflects changes not only in society but also in the museum’s values.

Avoid gender-specific occupational words.

worker not workman

police officer not policeman

However, if you are referring to a specific man or woman, the gender-specific term may be appropriate.

Jack Walls is a policeman.

Use ‘humanity’, ‘humankind’, ‘humans’ or (even better) ‘people’, not ‘mankind’.

Plural pronouns and possessives

Avoid using constructions like ‘he/she’ or ‘his/her’ for inclusiveness. Use the plural pronoun and possessives (‘they’, ‘their’, ‘theirs’) with the singular, if you need to refer gender-neutrally to a specific situation.

A new employee needs a buddy for their first few days in the job.



genus, genera

The plural of ‘genus’ is ‘genera’.



geographical features and regions

See place names.



glossing

Gloss words requiring translation when they first appear. Use parentheses.

The cloak accumulates mana (prestige and authority) as it is handed down over the generations.

In exhibition labels, regard the main heading, body text, and object information as separate for the purposes of glossing. Readers on the move may pause only momentarily by the label, and the gloss should be available in whatever part their eye alights on.



glottal stops

The diacritical mark for a glottal stop is an opening quote mark (in serif typefaces, ‘6’ not ‘9’).

Hawai‘i, Ha‘apai, ‘ie toga

When words with an initial glottal stop start a sentence, capitalise the first letter.

‘Ie toga are the most prized items in Samoan gift exchange.



GNS Science

Use the full name, not GNS alone

(Requested via Eleanor Laban, email 21/8/14)



government, Government

Use an initial capital for ‘Government’ only when referring to a specific government in full. After the first mention, you can drop the capital when not referring to the name in full.

For governments generically speaking, use lower case.

the New Zealand Government > the government

the National Government > the government

The various governments of Europe …



governor of New Zealand

This title changed to ‘governor-general’ in 1917. Use capitals before the name of an incumbent.

Governor of New Zealand George Grey



governor-general, governors-general

Use ‘governors-general’ as the plural form of this noun. Use capitals before the name of an incumbent.

Governor-General Anand Satyanand led the proceedings.



Great Depression, the

Use ‘the Great Depression’ or ‘the Depression’ (initial capitals). Specify the 1930s if this context hasn’t already been established.



greenstone

‘New Zealand greenstone’ is the common English gloss for pounamu, a local form of jade. The general geological name for pounamu is nephrite; other varieties found here are serpentinite and bowenite. Gloss simply as greenstone if used adjectivally, as in ‘toki pounamu (greenstone adze)’.

In Māori contexts, names such as kahurangi, inanga, and tangiwai are given to varieties, both in appearance and location.

pounamu

half

Do not hyphenate when used adverbially or as part of a noun phrase.

only half alive; half sugar, half salt

half an hour; half past three; a half century

Hyphenate when adjectival.

half-hearted attempt, half-eaten meal, all items half-price



hand-coloured





hand-painted





handcraft, handcrafted





handicap, handicapped



Also see

disability

Keep handicaps for golf or neutral attributions such as ‘handicapped by her lack of English’, not for physical or learning disabilities.



handmade





hashtags

Don’t include a full stop after a hashtag, even when it comes at the end of a full sentence.
Share your visit with #AirNZ75



Hawai‘i, Hawaiian

Make sure you use a glottal stop (opening quote mark) rather than an apostrophe. The adjective doesn’t take a glottal because it is no longer an Hawaiian word but an English one.



Hawaiki





Hawke’s Bay





he/she, him/her, and his/hers



Also see

gender

Avoid using constructions like ‘he/she’ or ‘his/her’ for inclusiveness. Find suitable plural constructions or reword.

Alternatively, use the plural pronoun and possessives (‘they’, ‘their’, ‘theirs’) with the singular if you need to refer gender-neutrally to a specific situation.

A new employee needs a buddy to make them feel at home when they first arrive.



headdress





headings and heading cases



Also see

capitals (titles)

Length of headings

Keep headings short, with a strong link to the content below. Don’t assume that the reader will read the heading – repeat any important information in the main text and use full sentences.

Katipo spiders

Katipo spiders live in coastal …

not Katipo spiders

These spiders live in coastal …

The headings for exhibition labels may be slightly more ‘creative’ than others because they have a role in attracting attention. However, they should not be misleading and should certainly be connected to the label content. Also consider the online context – ie, if exhibition content is going online, then keywords will be important. Keeping keywords in mind is useful in all contexts.

Case

For headings (eg, exhibition segment headings and labels lower in the hierarchy), use sentence case rather than title case. This approach is consistent with wider trends, which are influenced by digital media.

People of the great ocean not People of the Great Ocean

In some instances, full capitals can work for headings – discuss this with the designer. In general, though, text with ascenders and descenders is much easier for people to read, especially readers on the move (ie, in exhibitions).

Exhibition names and other titles in headings

Italicise exhibition names and other titles when they are used in headings, but not when they are used on their own as headings.   

Italics

Check the legibility of cursive/italicised fonts used in headings.

Dashes and colons

When there is an en dash or colon in subsidiary headings (ie, anything below titles), stick with the sentence case style.

Colonialism – all bull?

Colonialism: all bull?



hip-hop, hip hop

Te Papa hyphenates ‘hip-hop’ as a noun and an adjective to avoid the apparent inconsistency otherwise. (Most dictionaries list the noun without a hyphen.)

hip-hop style

Hip-hop has flourished as a style.

hiphop

historian, historic, hotel

Use ‘an’ not ‘a’ before these words, unless they appear in a direct quote.



hoard vs horde

A ‘hoard’ is a store of things. A ‘horde’ is a large, often mobile, group.

A horde of prospectors came with their metal detectors to look for the hoard of treasure.



Host

Te Papa Hosts take an initial capital. Other hosts do not.



hyperlinks

Frontload keywords in your hyperlink.
Be clear about what users will get when they click (without being too wordy), using language consistent with the title of the content you’re linking to if possible.
In general, [VC14] separate hyperlinks from other text, starting from page left. Hyperlink the entire message (or at least the first few words from page left) rather than a word or two – ie, don’t embed hyperlinks in sentences.
Hyperlinks can be embedded if the information is incidental, such as a reference in a blog to a similar object held by Te Papa. Hyperlink only the key words.
Avoid ‘click here’.
Don’t use a full stop at the end of the hyperlink, even when it forms a full sentence.
When linking to documents, add the document type and size in parentheses.
Key words in online captions, such as an artist’s name, can be hyperlinked to Collections Online and the Ngā Toi | Arts Te Papa website.

How to insert a hyperlink

Insert hyperlinks into Word files rather than supply the web team with URLs and expect them to do it for you.

Go to the web page you want to link to and copy (Ctrl C) the URL (web address) from the address bar.
Back in your Word file, select the relevant text for hyperlinking. (Remember to highlight the whole line.)
Go to the ‘Insert’ menu and select ‘Hyperlink’.
Enter the URL (Ctrl V) in the ‘Address’ field. (The cursor should already be there.)
Click ‘OK’.
Voila! Your hyperlink is there and will work once your content is loaded onto the website. (Don’t worry if it doesn’t work when you click on it. Just right click and select ‘Open Hyperlink’. You can also remove a hyperlink this way.)



hyphens



Also see

adverbs that qualify adjectives

dashes

numbers

Compound words

Some compound words carry hyphens, and some do not. The trend is for the hyphen to disappear once usage has become well established, eg, email. Te Papa has chosen its own style (hyphenated or unhyphenated) for certain words. Otherwise, see the Oxford New Zealand Dictionary or the Concise Oxford Dictionary for guidance on particular words.

Hyphenated prefixes

Words containing prefixes often carry hyphens after the prefix, for example, ‘non-violent’. This is nearly always the case where the last letter of the prefix and the first letter of the root word are vowels, for example, ‘pre-empt’ and ‘re-admit’, with exceptions being ‘cooperate’ and ‘coordinate’.

Compound adjectives (adverbs that qualify adjectives)

Use a hyphen between a common or short adverb and the adjective it qualifies when placed before the noun.

a little-known singer, a well-prepared speech, a hard-fought game, a long-term project

Drop the hyphen when the phrase comes after the noun and verb.

The speech was well prepared.

The game was hard fought.

Don’t use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly.

sharply rising profit, poorly made products

Be aware that use of hyphens with compound adjectives can change the meaning completely. Compare the following.

5 metre-long pieces of fabric (means 5 pieces of fabric, each 1 metre long)

5-metre-long pieces of fabric (means pieces of fabric, each 5 metres long)

Numbers

Hyphenate simple fractions.

one-fifth, three-quarters

Hyphenate numbers from 21 to 99 if these numbers are spelled out at the start of a sentence.

Eighty-five kilograms of cheese …

For simplicity, don’t end a stand-alone word with a hyphen in exhibition text:

A group of 8 and 9-year-olds (not ‘A group of 8- and 9-year-olds’)[VC15] 

Hyphenation in unjustified text alignment

If text is typeset ragged (unjustified) right, do not break normally unhyphenated words across the ends of lines.



I vs me

Make sure you do not use ‘I’ (subject) when it should be ‘me’ (object).

Not They have invited Sheba and I to dinner.

but They have invited Sheba and me to dinner.

Not I’d rather you than I.

but I’d rather you than me.

The test is: does ‘I’ work when you remove the other part of the ‘and I’ phrase? ‘They have invited I to dinner’, ‘I’d rather I’?



ie



Also see

abbreviations

This is the abbreviation for ‘id est’ (that is to say). Avoid using ‘ie’, except where space is limited (as in a table). Use ‘that is’.

Place a comma before and after the abbreviation. Don’t use full stops or spaces.

In good weather, manuhiri (visitors) use Te Ara a Tāne, ie,  the external access to Te Marae.

Be careful not to confuse ‘ie’, which specifies something, with ‘eg’, which gives something as an example.



inclusiveness

See disability, elderly, gender, handicap, or he/she.



in order to



Also see

plain English

Avoid using ‘in order to’. Just use ‘to’.





in vs at

See at vs in.



index, indexes, indices

The plural of index is indexes, except for economic and scientific context, where it is indices.



indirect (reported) speech

See quotation marks and speech punctuation.



infer vs imply

To ‘infer’ is to deduce from evidence. To ‘imply’ is to hint at something.

You implied that I was stupid … well, that was what I inferred from your remark.

initialisms

See acronyms.



initials

install, installation

Te Papa keeps to the US English tendency for a double consonant in the root verb here.



instructional labels



Also see

running time

Instructional labels are associated with AVs or interactives. Follow this format

Title of AV or interactive [title case]

Watch the video to see … / Push the button to hear ... / Discover how …

3:18 (if necessary)

Screens continuously [or other relevant info if necessary]

Courtesy statement [if necessary]



intensifiers

Ask yourself before writing intensifying words like very, really, absolutely, and particularly: are they necessary? Habits of speech are one thing. But when you have little space or time for communicating, don’t waste it on redundant intensifiers.

The outing was [really] tremendous.



internet

Use lower case, not ‘Internet’.



interpretive

Use ‘interpretive’, not ‘interpretative’, for exhibition text and design, and the work of interpreters in museums.



introductory clauses and phrases



Also see

dangling participles

In exhibition and web writing, avoid complicated introductory clauses and phrases. Readers on the move have little patience for puzzling out these kinds of inversion.

Having worked as an editor at Te Papa, and much praised there for his eagle eye, Samuel Francis was horrified by the abundance of grammatical errors in students’ work.

Get the subject of the sentence as near to the sentence’s beginning as possible. Simple adverbial phrases are OK.

In 1999, the whole family moved to Australia.



Ireland

Ireland is not part of the UK/Britain. Use ‘Éire (Ireland)’ or simply ‘Ireland’. ‘Republic of Ireland’ is merely descriptive – the official names of the state are those above.  



italics



Also see

art works (series and portfolios of)

bold text

capitals (titles)

emphasis

foreign words and phrases

glossing

quotation marks (titles)

scientific names

scriptures and sacred writings

Titles

Use italics (and title case) for the titles of:

books (except the Bible and books of the Bible, which are roman without quotation marks)
newspapers and other periodicals (check whether the definite article is part of the name or not, eg, The Dominion Post but the Waikato Times)
newsletters[VC16]  and individual titles in a series of publications (eg, He Rauemi Resource Guide 6: Minimising Disaster)[VC17] 
long poems considered books in themselves
plays
films, videos, video games[VC18] , and DVDs
radio and television series
ballets
long musical works like operas and symphonies
collections of recorded music (eg, CDs)
exhibitions
individual art works.
Use italics for the names of ships (excluding abbreviations preceding the ship names, eg, HMS Endeavour).

NOTE: This italics style does not apply when the title appears as a heading or subheading on its own.

NOTE: Don’t use italics for the titles of websites,[VC19]  chapters, articles, short stories, short poems, individual songs, essays, episodes of television and radio series, video clips (fragments of a larger video), [VC20] unpublished texts (eg, theses and manuscripts, and manifestos[VC21] ), or events (eg, lectures and conferences). Don’t use them for series portfolios of art works, or book or play [VC22] series (eg, He Rauemi Resource Guides).[VC23] 

Scientific names

Use italics for biological genera and species.

Phormium tenax, Rattus rattus

Genera mentioned in a general way are roman.

My sore throat was caused by a staphylococcus infection.

Emphasis

You can use italics sparingly for emphasis. Because italics are harder to read than roman text, avoid widespread use, especially online and in exhibition text.

Readability of italics in exhibition text and headings

Consider readability before using very curly italics for heading fonts.

Words in languages other than English

Never italicise Māori and Pacific words, and don’t usually italicise words in other languages, especially those that have the status of community languages in New Zealand. Simply include a gloss in parentheses directly after the word on the first mention. Re-gloss later mentions only if they are some distance from the first, eg, in a new exhibition label or another part of the label (such as the object descriptor in an EOL).

apostrophes (possessives)

‘Its’ is the possessive form of ‘it’ (belonging to it) and doesn’t take an apostrophe.

Both the horse and its rider are shown.

‘It’s’ is the contraction of ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

It’s a long way from here.

It’s been a very bad day.

TIP: If you can read the sentence saying ‘it is’ or ‘it has’, use an apostrophe. If you can’t, then don’t use an apostrophe.

lay vs lie

To ‘lay’ is to put down, aside etc; its past form is ‘laid’. It can take an object.

Let’s lay aside our differences.

We laid the table for ten.

The chook is laying an egg.

To ‘lie’ is to be in a horizontal position; its past form is ‘lay’. The past participle is ‘lain’. It does not take an object.

Lie down here.

See -ed vs -t endings.



legibility

Legibility is to do with the visual presentation of the printed word. Here are some basic guidelines for exhibition text.

Type size and leading

Use at least 20-point type size (ideally more) for main text where labels are on the wall, and especially where visitors have to stand some distance away from objects (eg, art exhibitions). Use at least 18-point type for main text on back-lit label rails. (Also see ‘Te Papa exhibition text hierarchy’ in Pou Mataaho.)

Smaller sizes are fine for secondary text like image credits, acquisition history information, etc. That said, if photograph captions/captions are doing important interpretive work, consider a larger type size.

The recommended range of leading (spacing between lines in a paragraph) for body text is a minimum of 130 to a generous 150 percent of the type size. So an 18-point typeface should have 24–27-point leading, a 24-point typeface should have 32–36-point leading, and so on.

Typefaces

The arguments about serif versus sans serif typefaces are largely academic in a display environment where the reading task is relatively short. There is a huge range of typefaces available – put a priority on clarity and simplicity. Classic fonts offer understated elegance, never diverting attention from the message to themselves.

Case

In general, avoid full capitals. Text with ascenders and descenders is much easier for people to read, especially readers on the move (ie, in exhibitions). However, full capitals can work in some headings – discuss this with the designer.

Type style

Use italics sparingly for emphasis in running text. They are tiring to read extensively.

Contrast

For legibility, nothing beats the maximum contrast of black type on a white background. Reversed-out text (white on black or other colours) tends to flicker and blur and is especially difficult to read when the font is small. Treat other colour combinations of text and background with great restraint. Test in exhibition conditions before you commit to it, ie, low and possibly indirect lighting.

Column-width comfort zone

Avoid going narrower than 30 characters (average 5–6 words) per line – less and you get dizzy from the rapid returns. Avoid going wider than 70 characters (average 10–12 words) – more and you feel you’re never going to stop.

Text alignment: justified vs ragged right

Avoid justified text, especially in exhibition text, as it can lead to squashed or overly spacious lines that require extra checking and adjustment at layout stage. Justified text also makes it difficult to keep word groups (eg, ‘New Zealand’) together on the same line rather than on separate lines.

less vs fewer

See fewer vs less.



liaison, liaise

‘Liaise’, not ‘liase’, is the verb.



licence vs license

‘Licence’ is the noun, as in driving licence, liquor licence. The verb form is to ‘license’ – licensed to sell liquor, kill etc.



lie vs lay

See lay vs lie



like



Also see

dangling participles

like vs such as

Make sure you are comparing the items you want to compare when using the preposition ‘like’.

Not Like the prime minister, his time spent in the mountains restored his sanity.

The example above compares ‘the prime minister’ with ‘his time’.

But Like the prime minister, he found that spending time in the mountains restored his sanity.



like vs such as

When you introduce examples, are you inclined to use ‘such as’ rather than ‘like’? There is no meaning-based reason for this favouritism, which seems to have gained currency from academic writing style. In effect, the two are interchangeable.



lists

See bullet points.



literally

Use ‘literally’ only if something is actually so.

He literally jumped out of the chair with surprise.



live-stream vs livestream

Use ‘live-stream’ as both verb and noun. According to the Oxford dictionary online, ‘livestream’ is often the noun (versus the hyphenated verb), but this just looks inconsistent to the uninformed viewer, so we’ll stick with the hyphenated form for both.



loan vs lend

To loan and to lend are interchangeable in their meaning of giving someone temporary use of an item you own. Don’t use ‘loan’ when you mean ‘borrow’.

A loan is the transaction of borrowing and lending, or something that has been lent.



loathe vs loath

To ‘loathe’ is to detest. To be ‘loath’ is to be unwilling. Spelling of ‘loath’ as ‘loathe’ is common. Avoid the confusion.

We loathed the committee chair, but we were loath to put a motion of no confidence in her.



localities

See place names.



long term, long-term

‘Long term’ is the noun. Use a hyphen when adjectival (long-term exhibition).

majority

‘Majority’ takes a plural verb when used with countable nouns. Strictly speaking, it should be used only with countable nouns, not mass nouns.

The majority of people not The majority of the work

However, in most cases, the plain English ‘Most’ is preferred (‘Most people’, ‘Most of the work’). Ask yourself whether ‘majority’ is necessary.



Manawatū, the

Use ‘the’ to refer to the region.

Manawatu

Māori

This is the singular and plural form of this word in English.

Check the use of the macron in names of organisations. Don’t assume its presence, especially in historical references (eg, Maori Battalion). If an organisation still exists today and takes the macron (eg, Māori Women’s Welfare League), use the macron in historical references to that organisation too.

Māori time sequence

Some predominantly Māori exhibitions use the time sequence designed by scholar Hirini Moko Mead to indicate the likely dates for taonga (treasures) when the exact dates are unknown. (Check with the curator.) The sequence, which was designed in the 1980s, is centred on the metaphor of growth.

Where the exact date is known, don’t use this dating system.

Ngā Kākano: The Seeds (1100–1300) – the era of initial human settlement of Aotearoa New Zealand
Te Tipunga: The Growth (1300–1500) – the era when Māori styles became distinct from their Pacific predecessors
Te Puāwaitanga: The Blossoming (1500–1800) – the era that saw the flowering of a dynamic, sophisticated culture rooted in the landscape of this country
Te Huringa I, II, III: The Turning (1800–present) – the era of change, adaptation, and conflict as Māori encountered European culture

Spelling out

Spell out numbers below 10, except when referring to measurements like length/distance, speed, weight/mass, area, volume, temperature, and power/energy – see units of measurement below. Use figures for all numbers above 10.

three figs, eight trees, 84 players, two days, eight weeks[VC26] 

An exception to spelling out numbers below 10 is when the numbers are being compared. Consistency is more important. Figuring all the numbers may be the best solution.

The lady owned 4 rabbits, 16 mice, and 10 dogs.

She used to have 1 dog – now she has 12.

Most style books say that you should not figure a number above 10 when the number starts a sentence. They recommend spelling out in such situations. However, Te Papa emphasises immediate understanding in exhibitions and online, and we think that using numerals to start a sentence in those contexts can sometimes be okay. In other contexts, spell out or rephrase.

Units of measurement

Use figures for units of measurement – when spelled in full and when abbreviated to symbols.

Spell out the units of measurement rather than use symbols, except when space is limited (eg, in a table) or when the text is mathematical or scientific. Exceptions are money symbols (eg, $, £), which you can use in the main text to denote currency.

Always spell out with lower-case letters, even when the abbreviation (symbol) has a capital.

10 percent not 10%

12 hours not 12h

10 centimetres not 10cm

50 kilometres per hour not 50km/h

3 kilograms not 3kg

5 square kilometres not 5km2

6 litres not 6l

40 degrees Celsius not 40°C

100 volts not 100V

Never add an ‘s’ to the end of the symbol, even when talking about numbers of more than one.

4kg not 4kgs

10hr not 10 hs or 10hrs

Don’t place a space between the figure and the symbol.

4kW not 4 kW

8m2 not 8 m2

20% not 20 %

4°C not 4° C

75W not 75 W

Ordinal numbers

Treat ordinal numbers (first, second … 50th) in the same way as cardinal numbers (one, two … 50). See spelling out above.

Don’t use superscript for ordinal numbers like 43rd, 50th. Use normal roman letters – 43rd, 50th. Change your autocorrect (Tools/AutoCorrect Options/AutoFormat As You Type).

Times, dates, ages

Use figures for precise expressions of time, for dates, and for ages.

4,000 not 4000

US$1,000 not US$1000

12,000 people not 12000 people or 12 000 people

Money

Use figures for money. Place the country abbreviation before the currency symbol. Use a comma to separate thousands. Don’t include spaces.

object labels

italics

Object labels (OLs) are labels for collection items (including exhibition photographic prints). They are the most common and probably most read labels, so consistency is key. They are very detailed and require rigorous proofreading.

OL style is covered below under the three types of exhibition. Labels for props, replicas/fascsimiles, and models differ slightly – their style is covered under number 4 below.

1.   Multidisciplinary exhibitions

2.   Art exhibitions

3.   Natural history exhibitions

4.   Props, replicas/facsimiles, and models



1. Multidisciplinary exhibitions

OLs in multidisciplinary exhibitions have four parts: title or descriptor line; maker line; media line; acquisition history line (with object registration number). The exhibition team decides their exact treatment. Record such decisions in an exhibition style sheet.

Title/Descriptor date
[made] by name (birth date–death date), iwi, country/ies
[made from] material, material
Acquisition history (object registration number)

Purchased 2003 (2003-0044-1)

(1.i) Title or descriptor line                                                    

Use bold, except for the date.
Don’t use punctuation between the descriptor and date, just a single space (or two spaces if the title is in italics).
Use appropriate capitals and italics for proper names and titles of works.
Use ‘about’ not ‘circa’ for works of uncertain date (within a range of +/- 5 years).
Light Fantastic 2004

Secessionist-style vase 1920s–30s

Untitled about 1947

(1.ii) Maker line

Use plain roman, lower case.
Precede the name with ‘made by’ or ‘by’, depending on the style chosen for the exhibition (usually ‘made by’ for objects, ‘by’ for art works). If the maker is unknown, say ‘maker/artist/photographer/iwi (tribe) unknown’.
Place birth–death dates in parentheses after the name. If the century (eg, 19) is the same in both dates, list it in the birth date only. For makers still living, list the birth date only, followed by an en dash, eg, 1950–.
Place iwi affiliations before the country/ies, with ‘iwi (tribe/s)’ afterwards.
Use a comma before the maker’s nationality (country of birth, domicile, or both). Use a slash to separate multiple countries.
If more than one person or group is involved (eg, designer and maker), separate their information with a semicolon.

designed by Augie March (1927–2001), United States; manufactured by Skellerup Industries, New Zealand

NOTE: In predominantly Māori exhibitions, you don’t need to list ‘New Zealand’. Just place the iwi affiliations after the maker’s name, separated by a comma. In a list of multiple affiliations, use commas between, with ‘and’ before the final one.

by Winitana Petera, Ngāti Wāhi and Ngāti Katoa iwi (tribes)

maker unknown, probably Ngāi Tahu iwi (tribe)

(1.iii) Media line

Use plain roman, lower case.
Separate the materials by commas, no ‘and’ before the final element.
Generally use ‘made from’ only in exhibitions for younger people; otherwise, leave it out.

polystyrene, iron, sugar, ink, cotton wool

pen and ink with wash

made from gold

made from barbed wire, timber posts

(1.iv) Acquisition history line

See Appendix D for a listing of agreed credit lines for items that have been acquired from various gifts, bequests, purchases, and sources of funding.

Use plain roman. (When designed, this line will be smaller than other lines.)
Capitalise the first word.
Do not end with a full stop (as for all other credits).
For purchases, don’t use a comma before the date.
For loans, use any wording specified in loan agreements (including for the name of the lender). It is not usual to give the location of a lending institution.
Include the object registration number in parentheses at the end.

2. Art exhibitions

OLs in art exhibitions have the same four parts as those in multidisciplinary exhibitions, but the maker/artist line is first and the title line is second.

Name (birth date–death date), iwi, country/ies
Title/Descriptor date
material, material
Acquisition history (object registration number)

Follow the style points set out under 1. Multidisciplinary exhibitions above, except for those points on the maker and media lines below.

(2.i) Artist line

Use bold for the name and plain roman for the other information.
Don’t precede the name with ‘made by’ or ‘by’. If the artist is unknown, say ‘Artist/Photographer unknown’.
If more than one person or group is involved, put their information on separate lines, with their role in parentheses after each.

3. Natural history exhibitions

Natural history OLs have four main parts: specimen descriptor line; origin of specimen line, distribution line, acquisition history line (with object registration number). Sometimes, only the origin line or distribution line is included, not both.

Common name, Māori name[FW31] , Scientific name
origin of specimen
distribution of species

(3.iv) Acquisition history line

Follow the style points set out under 1. Multidisciplinary exhibitions (1.iv) above.



4. Props, replicas/facsimiles, and models

(i) Prop labels

Props are original objects of the era but not collection items. The format is the same as for object labels, minus the acquisition history line. There may, however, be a credit.

Replicas are exact copies of collection items that can’t be displayed, usually for conservation reasons. Facsimiles are paper replicas – of prints, manuscripts, books, etc. The format for both is similar to that for object labels, as below, but doesn’t generally include a materials line.

Include either the acquisition history (when the original is Te Papa’s) or a credit (when the original is from elsewhere).

Royal Wax Vestas coronation matchbox 1953 (replica)
original made by New Zealand Wax Vesta Co Ltd
Original acquisition history unknown

Personal-effects bag 1918 (replica)
original maker unknown
Original gift of Miss P A Rolfes, 1966

Anti-Vietnam war poster 1971 (replica)
original maker unknown
Courtesy of Alexander Turnbull Library (MS-Papers-2511-5/1/25-9)

Exhibition prints are not considered replicas, even though they are, in a sense, copies of original photos. Present them as regular object labels.

(iii) Model labels

Models are items created for the exhibition. Describe the model only – don’t list maker or materials. Set the line in bold.

Model of a 1950s state house, 1:20 scale



object name

When an object has a proper noun – usually a unique object – there is no need to use quotes.

Uenuku

Kirikiri (cape), Rakairoa 2, 2008 [VC32] 



oil on canvas

Not ‘oil paint on canvas’[VC33] 



OK vs okay

Te Papa style is to stick to the initials form.



OL

See object labels.



online

There is no hyphen in this word.



only

Avoid ambiguity with ‘only’ by placing it next to the word or phrase it applies to. Note the possible differences in meaning in these examples.

Only paid-up members got notice of the meeting on Wednesday. (Refers to ‘paid-up members’)

Paid-up members got only notice of the meeting on Wednesday. (Refers to ‘notice’ as distinct from, say, an agenda)

Paid-up members got notice only of the meeting on Wednesday. (Refers to ‘meeting on Wednesday’, not any other meeting)

Paid-up members only got notice of the meeting on Wednesday. (Ambiguous: could refer to ’notice’ or ‘on Wednesday’)

Paid-up members got notice of the meeting only on Wednesday. (Refers to Wednesday)



onto vs on to

Distinguish between simple motion …

He jumped onto the roof.

… and the use of on + to with phrasal verbs like go on, come on, pass on.

She went on to Christchurch after watching whales in Kaikoura.

Compare these two examples.

They moved onto the marae as soon as they arrived.

They moved on to marae business in the next item of the agenda.

Avoid using ‘onto’ when ‘on’ will do.

She paints slogans on walls rather than onto walls.



operas (titles of)

Use title case and italics for the titles of long musical works like operas and symphonies and collections of recorded music (eg, CDs). For more information, see italics (titles).



Oxford comma

See commas.



Pacific islands, Pacific islanders

Note the lower-case ‘i’ for ‘islands’. ‘Pacific islands’ is not a proper name – rather, it’s descriptive of a region.

In general, use ‘Pacific people’ over ‘Pacific islanders’.



page, p, pp

Spell out ‘page’, except where space is limited (eg, in a table or reference list). When using the abbreviated form, use ‘p’ (page) or ‘pp’ (pages), with a space after and no full stop.

pp 43–44, p 16

Insert a non-breaking space between the two elements to ensure they don’t break over lines.



palaeontology





papier-mâché

Use the diacritics on this word when referring to artists’ materials or media.

papier mache

paragraphing



Also see

bullet points

legibility

In exhibition and website text, keep paragraphs to an upper limit of around 60 words.

Use block paragraphing: set paragraphs full out to the margin, do not indent the first line. Keep text unjustified (ragged right). Never centre text for reading.

Use at least a line space (one hard return) to separate paragraphs.



parentheses



Also see

commas (non-defining clauses) and dashes (sentences)

Use round brackets ( ) for parentheses in running text. The most common use for these in exhibition text is for glosses.

Use square brackets [ ] to indicate an interpolation, eg, a gloss of a word or some other insertion in a quote.

Use square brackets within round brackets for parentheses within parentheses.

Parenthetical information

You can use parentheses for information that is not essential to the text. Include the final full stop inside the parentheses only if the parenthetical information is a full sentence in itself and not part of another sentence.

When the team was losing, we got stuck into the ref (as fans do).

When the team was losing, we got stuck into the ref. (All fans tend to do that.)

Pairs of commas and dashes can function in a similar way.

In exhibitions, generally avoid parentheses. There should be little need for them in any case.



parliament, Parliament

See capitals (proper nouns, legislation).



passive verbs

See sentences (active and passive verbs).



PDF

Like other initialisms, this is in capitals. No need to spell out as Portable Document Format since PDF is the more familiar term.



peacekeeper, peacekeeping

There is no hyphen in these words.



Pearl Harbor

Note the American spelling.



percent



Also see

numbers (percentages)

Spell out as one word in ordinary text.

We’re on show 100 percent of the time.



periodicals and magazines

See italics.



periods

See full stops.



personal names



Also see

capitals (proper names)

Don’t use full stops after people’s initials but place single spaces between them.

M T Woollaston, John A Lee

Capitalise nicknames.

King Dick, The Great Pretender, the Fireworks Lady

Macrons on Māori personal names

In English text, Te Papa uses macrons on Māori personal names (for people both living and deceased) where appropriate. Check the preference of living people (or ask the curator to do so). For people who are deceased, consult the Māori Writer.

Exhibition text

In object labels, give creators of works the names they are most commonly known by in their working lives.

C F Goldie, M T Woollaston (not Toss Woollaston or Sir Tosswill Woollaston), Rita Angus



phenomenon, phenomena

Note that ‘phenomena’ is the plural form of ‘phenomenon’.



phone numbers

Use spaces.

(04) 381 7000, +64 4 381 7000, +64 22 657 8124



place names



Also see

capitals (proper nouns)

Capitalise the names of places, geographical features, and regions.

Waikato River, Mt Taranaki, Cook Strait, the Far North, the West Coast (South Island), Volcanic Plateau, Ninety Mile Beach

Take care when capitalising place names and their subsidiary geographical features.

Waihi Beach (an official place name)

Sumner beach (the beach at Sumner)

Waikanae River estuary

The New Zealand Gazetteer on the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) website is an excellent source for New Zealand place name verification.

Macrons on Māori place names

Te Papa macronises place names. Consult with the Māori Writer.



plain English



Also see

sentences

Plain English is language that people can understand on one reading. (We prefer to think of it as clear English to avoid the implication that it means boring, flat language – it doesn’t!) Plain/clear English is important in all Te Papa publications, but particularly exhibition and website text, where readers are on the move or browsing for information.

Use familiar rather than complex language. If you need to use technical words (sparingly), define them.
Organise information clearly, with the audience’s needs in mind.
‘Chunk’ information into short paragraphs (up to 60 words ideally), with subheadings to signal new themes.
Write simple, clear sentences, avoiding complex introductory clauses (inversions) and parenthetical clauses.
Use ‘you’ for the reader wherever appropriate (especially in web and brochure text).
Prioritise the active voice, which focuses on the agent, over the passive voice (‘Māori used the stone’ over ‘The stone was used by Māori’). The passive voice certainly has a place, but ask yourself whether it is appropriate/necessary.
Avoid jargon, idioms, slang, and  in-jokes – unless your audience is specific and will understand them.
Ensure that the layout and design support reader understanding.
Publications for specialist audiences may warrant some technical language. These publications, however, should follow plain English principles more generally – that is, they should be clear enough to understand on one reading.



plays

plurals



Also see

apostrophes

For guidance on plurals of specific words, use the ‘Find’ function of Word. For guidance on agreements between singular and plural subjects and their verbs, see Peters on ‘agreement’.

Plurals of Māori words

Māori words in English text have the same plurals as they do in Māori. Māori nouns do not generally show a plural form, with a few exceptions. The following commonly appear in English.

wahine (woman), wāhine (women)

tangata (person), tāngata (people)

kaumatua (elder), kaumātua (elders)



pm

See am and pm.



poems

See italics, capitals, and quotation marks.



Polynesia, Polynesian

Be careful about using these terms in contemporary contexts.  Use ‘eastern Pacific’ for the region and ‘eastern Pacific people’ as a general term for people from the region. The Pacific curators will give up-to-date guidance on specific usage.

Note this information from the Oceania exhibition (2011):

Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia

In the 1830s, French explorer Dumont d’Urville suggested classifying Oceania’s islands into three groups:

Melanesia (named for the dark skin colour of its people) – New Guinea and the islands extending east as far as Fiji
Micronesia – the comparatively tiny islands north of Melanesia and east of the Philippines
Polynesia – the vast triangle of islands bound by Hawai‘i to the north, Rapanui (Easter Island) to the east, and Aotearoa New Zealand to the south-west.
Many scholars have since rejected these groupings, which overlook the region’s settlement history.

Near Oceania, Remote Oceania

Some scholars divide the Pacific region into ‘Near Oceania’ and ‘Remote Oceania’. These terms stem from the region’s migration history, with South-east Asia as the probable origin of its first settlers.

Near Oceania refers to New Guinea and its adjacent islands, which began to be settled more than 40,000 years ago. Remote Oceania refers to the islands further out to sea. These islands began to be settled around 3,000 years ago, when seafarers developed the knowledge and technology to voyage across the open ocean. 



portfolios

See art works (series and portfolios of).



position titles



Also see

capitals (proper nouns)



Distinguish between a general mention of job titles and job designations associated with someone’s name. Capitalise the latter, but not the former.

Ian Guard, Security Coordinator, phone 7068

Floortalk given by Sean Mallon, Curator Pacific

The chief executive and the chairman of the board represented Te Papa.[f34] 

If in doubt about the exact job title, check with the position-holder. (The staff directory is also useful.)



possessives

See apostrophes (possessives).



post-modern



Also see

modern art, modernism, modernist, post-modern

Use a hyphen in ‘post-modern’.



practice vs practise

The noun is ‘practice’, the verb is ‘practise’.

It is good practice to practise your netball skills three times a week.



pre-book, pre-booking vs book

Use ‘book’ or ‘booking’, not ‘pre-book’ or ‘pre-booking’ – what other sort is there?



pre-European

Use a hyphen.



preschool

Don’t use a hyphen.



preventive

Use ‘preventive’, not ‘preventative’.

preventive conservation



prime minister

Use initial capitals only when referring to a prime minister’s title in full. After the first mention, you can drop the capitals when not referring to the title in full.

Prime Minister Helen Clark > the prime minister

Helen Clark became prime minister in 1999. [f35] 



principal vs principle

‘Principal’ is first in order, either as an adjective or a noun.

the principal aim; the principal of Lytton High School

A ‘principle’ is a law, rule, standard of conduct, etc.

Te Papa’s principles; a principle of physics; against my principles



printmaker, printmaking

These words don’t take a hyphen.



private collection

Use ‘On loan from a private collection’, not just ‘Private collection’. The words ‘On loan’ may seem unnecessary at Te Papa, but they add clarity when a label is transferred online.

In a virtual exhibition where the object is not physically in Te Papa, use ‘Private collection’.[VC36] 



program vs programme

‘Program’ is used for computer software; otherwise use programme.



proper names

See capitals (proper nouns) and personal names.



props and prop labels

See object labels (props, replicas/facsimiles, and models).



protester vs protestor

Use ‘protester’, not ‘protestor’.



punctuation

Punctuation style

In general, punctuation is set in the same weight, style, and font as the text surrounding it.

Have you seen the latest issue of Home and Garden? (question mark roman)

McCahon’s Northland Panels, Ahipara here I come, and other works from that period were included. (Commas all roman)

Exceptions include these examples.

Conclusions: The evidence from the research suggests that visitors do read labels. (Bold opening word takes a bold colon)

You did what? (Italics for emphasis continue into end-of-sentence punctuation)

I was talking to the author of Doomed! (Exclamation mark in the title also acts as end-of-sentence punctuation)

Exhibition text

Punctuation in exhibition signage reflects the need for the reader to grasp meaning quickly and easily. Commas, full stops, dashes, and quotation marks are the label writer’s stock-in-trade. Colons and semicolons will be used rarely.

Avoid using complex sentences that require you to comma off inversions and parenthetical phrases or clauses.



QR code

This is the abbreviation for Quick Response code, but use QR code as that is the more familiar term.

A QR code acts like a sort of barcode for web addresses. People with smartphones (phones that connect to the internet) can scan QR codes and be taken directly to a specific web address.



Qu’ran

Use this spelling, not Koran, for Islam’s sacred book.



qualifications

See awards and qualifications and capitals.



Queen Elizabeth II





Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee





Queen Victoria’s Jubilee Medal





quotation marks



Also see

capitals (titles)

speech punctuation

Use single quotation marks, not double quotation marks. See the exception in double quotation marks below.

Titles

Use single quotation marks with roman text inside when referring to the titles of chapters, articles, short stories, short poems, individual songs, essays, episodes of television and radio series, series or portfolios of art works, and unpublished texts (eg, theses and manuscripts).

Quotes, direct speech, and specific terms

Use single quotation marks for quotes and direct speech and also to highlight specific terms, eg, unusual words or uses of words or for ironical purposes. Always make the quote marks curly.

Roger Williams said that the water ‘just rushed into the house without warning’.

‘Bugger,’ Roger said. ‘I hate it when that happens.’

The word ‘bugger’ used to be considered offensive.

Don’t use quotation marks for reported (indirect) speech.

Roger says he hates it when that sort of thing happens.

He remarked that the ship was already listing when it left the port.

Double quotation marks

Use double quotation marks only when they are set inside the single quotation marks.

‘Why would an “expert” suggest something so stupid?’

Full stops

When presenting a quote, put the final full stop outside the quotation marks if the quote is a word, phrase, or other short extract from a longer piece of text and doesn’t have the feeling of a full sentence.

Mrs Brown said that the fireman who saved her cat was ‘brave and kind’.

Put the final full stop inside the quotation marks if the quote is the full original text and has the feeling of a full sentence.

Mrs Brown said, ‘That fireman was so brave and kind.’

I can only repeat her comment then: ‘Where else would a poor girl get diamonds?’

Capitals

Use a capital for the first word of the quote if the quote is a full sentence (or has the feeling of a full sentence in exhibition text), as in the examples directly above, but not if it is simply an extract (unless the first word is a proper name).



quotations



Also see

bibliographies

footnotes

Make sure that all quotations used in exhibition or website text are correctly sourced and transcribed. Make sure any permission needed to use copyright material has been obtained and that the permission is credited as requested.

See bibliographies and footnotes for guidance on standard formats for sources and references.

Anachronisms

Don’t ‘correct’ titles of publications, organisations, Acts of Parliament, and so on by inserting macrons or punctuation not originally there.

However, with quotations in exhibition text, it is reasonable to correct punctuation or update it to contemporary usage to aid readability.

Omissions

Use an ellipsis to indicate an omission in quotations, regardless of whether the omission comes in the middle of a sentence or between sentences. Retain the capital letter after the ellipsis if a sentence begins after an omission.

It is also reasonable (except in a strict scholarly context) to capitalise the new beginning word if the resumed quotation makes a complete sentence.

Do not use an ellipsis at the end of a quote, even if you’re omitting part of a sentence, unless the material could be misconstrued without it.

The tenth commandment includes domestic animals in covetousness: ‘Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s … ox, nor his ass.’

For pull-out quotes (these are usually longer ones), use italics for the quote and right-align the source in a smaller font.

You are invited to have coffee with Helen Hitchings to
mark the opening of her gallery where furniture, fabrics, pottery, and works of art by New Zealand designers will be displayed …

                                                         Invitation, May 1949[VC37]

Rapanui

This is one word, rather than two, according to Rapanui expert Poike Riroroko (2011).



re/re-

As a general guide, hyphenate the prefix ‘re-’ when it is followed by the vowels ‘e’ or ‘u’ (when not pronounced ‘yu’).

re-examine, re-entry, re-upholster

Use re (no hyphen) when followed by vowels a, i, o, and u (pronounced ‘yu’) and consonants.

reassemble, reinvent, reoccupy, reunite, reuse, rebuild, reconsider

But note these exceptions, especially when the unhyphenated version could be confused with another word.

We used to say ‘Runs for about 3 minutes’ in this instance, but with increasing use of bilingual text, that became unruly. The new format doesn’t require translation and is generally understood, especially as it is common online.



Saint

Capitalise and spell out ‘saint’ in ordinary text when it refers to a particular person.

Saint Paul, Saint Joan of Arc

Use the abbreviation ‘St’ in the names of places, churches etc.

Old St Paul’s, St Bathans



Sāmoa, Samoan

Sāmoa takes a macron – the correct name of the country, as used by the Language Commission there. Samoan, however, doesn’t as it is an English adjective.



scientific names

In object labels (OLs)

In natural history object labels, the scientific name comes after the common name and Māori name.

Hierarchy

This is the hierarchy for the scientific classification of organisms. There are elaborations and extensions, but this still works for everyday purposes.

kingdom, division (botany) or phylum (zoology), class, order, family, genus (plural genera), species

Capitals and italics

Use italics for genera and species. The genus has an initial capital, but the species epithet (the second word of the name of a species) does not.

Lophophora williamsii

Genera mentioned in a general way are roman.

My sore throat was caused by a staphylococcus infection.

From family up to kingdom, all group names are latinate names with plural endings. Use roman text, with an initial capital.

Plantae (kingdom), Caryophyllales (order), Cactaceae (family)

English derivatives are lower case.

amoeba, carnivores, mustelids

Abbreviations

In specialist writing, use ‘sp’ in roman to abbreviate the word ‘species’ (or ‘spp’ for more than one species).

Cambridgea sp

To shorten the genus name, spell out on first mention, then abbreviate to the initial letter.

Lampona murina > L murina



screen print vs screen-print

Screen print (noun) is the art work, but you screen-print (verb) the work.



scriptures and sacred writings

Capitalise but do not use italics for the names of scriptures and sacred writings.

the (Holy) Bible; the Qu’ran; the Upanishads; the Book of Mormon

Books of the Bible are treated similarly.

The Song of Solomon; The Gospel According to Saint Mark

References to biblical quotations

The examples below are an accepted reference style for quotations from the Bible.

I Samuel: 8 v1 (ie, First Book of Samuel, chapter 8, verse 1)

Revelation: 16 v4 (ie, Revelation of St John the Divine, chapter 16, verse 4)



seasons

Summer, autumn, winter, and spring are all lower case (except at the start of a sentence).



Second World War

In exhibition text, don’t use ‘Second World War’. Use ‘World War II’ – also the more common search phrase on the internet.

In web text, you may want to use ‘Second World War’ and ‘World War 2’ as well as ‘World War II’ because they are alternative key phrases.

These comments are directed at exhibition and website writing. Also see plain English for principles for all reader-focused writing

You can find excellent guidelines for sentence construction and connection in exhibition text in Meanings and Messages: Language guidelines for museum exhibitions by Ferguson, MacLulich, and Ravelli (Sydney: Australian Museum, 1995).

Sentence length

Keep sentences relatively short. Aim for less than 16–20 words. Sentences should rarely be longer than 24 words.

Sentence structure

Keep sentence structures simple. Readers on the move, on the floor and on the web, have little patience with figuring things out. Get to the subject of the sentence – the main clause – as soon as possible.

(i) Inversions

Avoid beginning sentences with information that qualifies the main clause – inversions.

However, 2- to 4-word brief introductory phrases like these are fine.

In early 2008, …  For example, … After his death, …

Very short clauses will work if they connect directly to the subject or action of the previous sentence.

… as she issued her demands. When she had left, the team …

Ask yourself whether an introductory subclause has any merit for flow and impact, including variation on other sentences surrounding it.

When it came to breakfast, Frith never went without.

Frith never went without breakfast.

Don’t include lots of subclauses. Break longer sentences in two.

The pathway, when it was commissioned, was reserved for women’s art, which caused controversy from the start.

The pathway was reserved for women’s art when it was commissioned. This decision caused controversy from the start.

Active and passive verbs

Construct your sentences using active verbs as much as possible. Passive verbs have a place – eg, in setting tone, creating flow, and placing emphasis – but choose to use them with care. They are harder to understand, especially for speakers of English as a second language. Try making passive verbs active – ask yourself, if this passive really necessary? Compare these examples.

Passive: She was loved by many people.

Active: Many people loved her.

Passive: Sessions are held daily and bookings should be made on the day at the Information Desk.

Active: We hold sessions daily. Book for them on the day at the Information Desk.

Direct speech (dialogue)

Sometimes direct speech is broken into two sections. When the first part of the speech is the end of a sentence, use a comma inside the closing quote mark, place a full stop after the attribution (he said etc), and use a capital to begin the next part.

‘Go away,’ he said. ‘The Writing Team is no place for you.’

When the first part of the speech isn’t the end of a sentence, use a comma after the attribution, and then a lower-case letter to begin the next section of speech.

‘April,’ she said, ‘you have to get some rest.’

Reported (indirect) speech

Don’t use quote marks for reported (indirect) speech.

tapa

bark cloth

Don’t write ‘tapa cloth’ but ‘tapa (bark cloth)’.

The Tongan word is ‘ngatu’, and the Fijian is ‘masi’.



tautologies

Watch out for tautologies. These occur when words and phrases put together say the same thing.

Men swarmed to the area not Men swarmed to the area in large numbers

‘Swarmed’ conveys the idea of large numbers, so the second part of the sentence is unnecessary.

The town was deserted not No one was left in the deserted town

‘Deserted’ means that no one was left.

Individual kupu (words) on English-language web pages are glossed either in parentheses or with a hover function.

The first time the kupu (word) is used

Use a hover gloss if the word is on the list Te reo Māori words to gloss consistently on www.tepapa.govt.nz

Exceptions are listed too. You can add an exception if there’s a good reason to do so – check with the web team.

If it’s not on the list and:

most readers of the page are likely to know the kupu, use a hover gloss
most readers of the page are unlikely to know the kupu, gloss with parentheses.
Further use of the same kupu on the same page

People skim pages, so don’t assume everything will be read.

If both kupu are fairly close (eg, in the same short paragraph), you can leave the second instance unglossed.
If the kupu are further apart, gloss the word. Use a hover gloss or parentheses, depending on the likely needs of your reader. Eg, repeated use of ‘tapu’ on a page about sacred places could be glossed with a hover.[VC41]

that vs which



Also see

commas (non-defining clauses and phrases)

The word ‘that’ introduces defining clauses. Defining clauses are essential to the meaning of the sentence and cannot be removed without affecting the sense.

The word ‘which’ (and never ‘that’) introduces non-defining clauses, which give extra information. Non-defining clauses can be removed from the sentence without destroying the sense.

This is the house that Jack built.

This house, which Jack built, is falling down.

The car that I drive is broken. (My wife’s car is okay though.)

not

The car, which I drive, is broken.

TIP: ‘That’ defines, ‘which’ informs.

Whitbread Round the World Race

Now called the ‘Volvo Ocean Race’ (as of 2011).



who or whom?



‘Whom’ is the object form of the relative pronoun ‘who’. In speech, the distinction between forms has become blurred. In writing, it is still definable.

‘Who’ corresponds to he/she/they. ‘Whom’ corresponds to him/her/them. Test the two out in these examples.

(i)

x She was the one whom he thought would be the winner.

‘Whom’ = the one = ‘her’. Would you say ‘her … would be the winner’? No, you’d say ‘she’. Therefore ‘who’ is correct:

aShe was the one who he thought would be the winner.

(ii)

x He was now grovelling to the people who he’d been abusing.

‘Who’ = the people = ‘they’. Would you say ‘he’d been abusing they’? No, you’d say ‘them’. Therefore ‘whom’ is correct:

aHe was now grovelling to the people whom he’d been abusing.



Wi-Fi

Use Wi-Fi, not WiFi.



winter

This is lower case. See seasons.



wonder box

This is the name for the children’s collections featured in NatureSpace Discovery Centre. Two words.



work of art

See art work.



world view





World War I, World War II

These are the preferred terms, rather than ‘the First World War’ or ‘the Second World War’, which are both longer and are not as commonly used as search phrases online. Note the roman numerals, rather than World War One/Two or World War 1/2.

In exhibition labels, try to use a non-breaking space between the elements of these phrases so that they don’t end up split over two lines.

In web text, you may also want to incorporate ‘First/Second World War’ and ‘World War 1/2’ because they are alternative key phrases.

However, also see First World War Centenary



worldwide

This has no hyphen.



worldwide web

Use lower case for this phrase.



x-ray

But the X-ray Room on Level 2.



your vs you’re

‘Your’ is a possessive adjective for something belonging to you. ‘You’re’ is the contraction of ‘you are’.



yours, ours, theirs

Never use apostrophes in these possessive pronouns.




 [FW1]TBC text highlighted yellow. This is where things get tricky because the issue is bound up with status.


 [f2]Check the Chicago Style Manual when the new one comes out.



VC: Chicago recommends lower case after a prefix. 31/12/15


 [VC3]Renewal: Māori name first?


VC:  [VC4]Needs more? Added 23/03/15


 [VC5]VC: We wouldn’t use this for art exhibitions at Te Papa, although maybe it would be used for travelling exhibitions or marketing materials. Detail this distinction? Also see highlighted examples directly below. 17/6/15


 [VC6]VC added 18/8/15


 [VC7]VC: This style below differs from Victoria Leachman’s recommendations, and what she is putting into practice, eg: http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/05/20/hitting-the-road-for-creative-commons-and-national-services-te-paerangi/

18/8/15


 [FW8]TBC. Do we consider these independent collections?


 [VC9]VC: When would this be? It’s what Victoria Leachman recommends, but I never see it added. May be more useful now in the digital space. 22/6/15


 [VC10]VC: Added 10/6/15


 [VC11]VC added. This is generally the style used in the documents, and by the government when referring to them. But it’s rare for us to describe such documents, so maybe this entry isn’t necessary. 7/1/16


 [VC12]VC Added 23/6/15


VC:  [VC13]I made up this rule – Chicago not helpful. 17/6/15


VC  [VC14]Added highlighted bits in this section 17/6/15


 [VC15]VC Added 23/03/15


 [VC16]VC added 7/1/16

 [f25]There is some inconsistency around this. See http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2848

Natural History Collection? See entry under collection/s.


 [VC26]VC added 23/03/15


 [VC27]VC added 5/1/16. From Ngāti Toa Rangatira


 [VC28]VC added 5/1/16. From New Zealand Photography Collected. Not sure if this is the right place to put these examples.

NB Album name was in single quotes. Inconsistent use in exhibition


 [VC29]Compare last two (new) examples with new examples under ‘Artist line’. Why is an album treated differently from a carte-de-visite?


 [VC30]VC added 5/1/16. From New Zealand Photography Collected


 [FW31]Suggest we reconsider this and put Māori name first. To discuss with curators and Paora.


 [VC32]VC Added 17/6


 [VC33]VC I think it’s clearer to include ‘paint’, but Te Papa doesn’t seem to do that – note examples in this Style Guide


 [f34]See note below.


 [f35]This entry is consistent with Te Ara and NZ History’s styles – but how comfortable are people with using lower case when referring implicitly to a specific person? We may want to reconsider this one. 


 [VC36]VC Added 17/6/15


 [VC37]VC added 6/1/16. This is the case with labels, but what about in other contexts? Specifically, web pages? I’ve asked the web team – haven’t heard back. Chicago doesn’t have anything to say about long quotes on websites.


 [VC38]VC Added 17/6/15


 [VC39]VC added 18/02/16


VC  [VC40]Added 10/12/15 based on website renewal


 [VC41]VC added 11/1/16 – not sure if it’s necessary. Slightly adapted from Web writing for www.tepapa.govt.nz


 [f42]Info here TBC. Confirm and potentially place in Appendix A instead of here.


 [VC43]VC added 7/1/16


 [VC44]VC: Deleted ‘Embed the URL in the text, rather than include it separately.’ as it seems to contradict ‘Hyperlinks’ entry
