<p>Revised September 2014</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc397851054">What is the Style Guide?</a></h1>

<p>The Te Papa Style Guide presents our &lsquo;house style&rsquo; &ndash; the conventions we use in written English, in print and on-screen. The Writing Team is expected to be the most familiar with the content, but the guide is also intended as a reference for others involved in writing, editing, or translating:</p>

<ul>
	<li>exhibitions and displays</li>
	<li>visitor publications</li>
	<li>website content</li>
	<li>marketing material</li>
	<li>wayfinding signage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why have a house style?</h2>

<p>Te Papa&rsquo;s reputation is built on delivering high quality. The text we produce reaches readers around New Zealand and the world &ndash; more than 2 million a year, including website users. Clear, engaging English is vital. Consistency, too, is important &ndash; it helps readers to access information and is a mark of professionalism.</p>

<p>On a practical level, a house style aids decision-making and results in greater efficiency.</p>
