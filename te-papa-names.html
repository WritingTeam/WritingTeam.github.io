<h1><a name="_Toc397851060">Appendix A &ndash; Te Papa names</a></h1>

<p>This appendix includes the names of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Te Papa spaces</li>
	<li>Te Papa exhibitions and stand-alone exhibits.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>(For the titles of Te Papa positions and divisions, use the staff directory on Kupenga.)</p>

<p>In some cases, &lsquo;The&rsquo; is part of the name and takes an initial capital, as in &lsquo;Te Marae&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>The Colossal Squid</em>&rsquo;. These names are listed under &lsquo;T&rsquo; for &lsquo;The&rsquo;.</p>

<p>If you have a query about a name, please contact the Senior Writer/Editor.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc397851061">Te Papa spaces</a></h2>

<p>Te Papa spaces with Māori names are often referred to only with their English name in English text. This is usually a matter of space and clarity of message. The Māori name, however, should be used in Māori text. (See &lsquo;Māori names of Te Papa spaces&rsquo; below.)</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc397851062"></a><a name="_Toc397850660"></a><a name="_Toc397850230">Māori names of Te Papa </a>spaces</h3>

<p>Only some spaces in Te Papa have Māori names. If a space doesn&rsquo;t have a Māori name, include the English name the first time you mention it (because that is the signage that appears in the museum). You can then describe it with the relevant Māori.</p>

<p>From 2018, new names for Te Papa spaces have been bilingual. The Māori name comes before the English name in wayfinding, for example on <a href="https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/plan-your-visit/map-te-papa">the Te Papa map</a>.</p>

<h2>Te Papa exhibitions and stand-alone exhibits</h2>

<h3><a name="_Toc397851064"></a><a name="_Toc397850662"></a><a name="_Toc397850232">Case</a></h3>

<p>Te Papa style is to use title case for exhibition names in running text (regardless of how they are presented graphically):<br />
<strong>Main</strong> <strong>Exhibition Name in Title Case: Tagline in Title Case</strong></p>

<p>Title case means initial capitals for all main words.</p>

<p>(Before 2016, we used sentence case for exhibition taglines &ndash; thus the inconsistency in titles listed below. Sentence case means initial capitals for the first word and proper nouns.)</p>

<p>Use a colon (not an en dash) between the main title and tagline.</p>

<p>If the exhibition has English and Māori names that work together, use a vertical slash (or &lsquo;pipe&rsquo;) between them rather than a colon.</p>

<p><em>Blood Earth Fire | Whāngai Whenua Ahi Kā</em></p>

<p><em>Whales </em><em>│Tohorā</em></p>

<h3><a name="_Toc397851065"></a><a name="_Toc397850663"></a><a name="_Toc397850233">Italics</a></h3>

<p>Use italics for the names of exhibitions, except stand-alone exhibits like the Britten motorbike, the <em>Endeavour</em> cannon (<em>Endeavour</em> is in italics because it&rsquo;s a ship name), and Phar Lap.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc397851066"></a><a name="_Toc397850664"></a><a name="_Toc397850234">Translations</a></h3>

<p>All exhibitions from 2013 have had Māori translations &ndash; these come first in exhibitions but are placed second in the list below to aid searchability. Do not translate earlier exhibition names.</p>

<p>In English marketing text, use both only where it makes sense to do so. Don&rsquo;t do so where the title would get too long and complicate the message. As an example, don&rsquo;t use <em>Gallipoli: The scale of our war | Karipori: Te Pakanga Nui</em>. Instead use <em>Gallipoli: The scale of our war</em>. In Māori marketing text, use the Māori version.</p>
