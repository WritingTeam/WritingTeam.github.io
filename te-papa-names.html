<p>In some cases, &lsquo;The&rsquo; is part of the name and takes an initial capital, as in &lsquo;Te Marae&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>The Colossal Squid</em>&rsquo;. These names are listed under &lsquo;T&rsquo; for &lsquo;The&rsquo;.</p>

<p>If you have a query about a name, please contact the Head of Writing/Editing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Te Papa spaces</h2>

<p>Te Papa spaces with Māori names are often referred to only with their English name in English text. This is usually a matter of space and clarity of message. The Māori name, however, should be used in Māori text. (See &lsquo;Māori names of Te Papa spaces&rsquo; below.)</p>

<h3>Māori names of Te Papa spaces</h3>

<p>Only some spaces in Te Papa have Māori names. If a space doesn&rsquo;t have a Māori name, include the English name the first time you mention it (because that is the signage that appears in the museum). You can then describe it with the relevant Māori.
