<p>In some cases, &lsquo;The&rsquo; is part of the name and takes an initial capital, as in &lsquo;Te Marae&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>The Colossal Squid</em>&rsquo;. These names are listed under &lsquo;T&rsquo; for &lsquo;The&rsquo;.</p>

<p>If you have a query about a name, please contact the Head of Writing/Editing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Te Papa spaces</h2>

<p>Te Papa spaces with Māori names are often referred to only with their English name in English text. This is usually a matter of space and clarity of message. The Māori name, however, should be used in Māori text. (See &lsquo;Māori names of Te Papa spaces&rsquo; below.)</p>

<h3>Māori names of Te Papa spaces</h3>

<p>Only some spaces in Te Papa have Māori names. If a space doesn&rsquo;t have a Māori name, include the English name the first time you mention it (because that is the signage that appears in the museum). You can then describe it with the relevant Māori.</p> 

<h2>Te Papa exhibitions and stand-alone exhibits</h2>

<h3>Case</h3>

<p>Te Papa style for exhibition names in running text (regardless of how they are presented graphically) is:<br />
<strong>Main</strong> <strong>Exhibition Name in Title Case: Tagline in sentence case</strong></p>

<p>Title case means initial capitals for all main words. Sentence case means initial capitals for the first word and proper nouns. Use a colon (not an en dash) between the main title and tagline.</p>

<p>If the exhibition has English and Māori names that work together, use a vertical slash between them rather than a colon.</p>

<p><em>Blood Earth Fire | Whāngai Whenua Ahi Kā</em></p>

<p><em>Whales </em><em>│Tohorā</em></p>

<h3>Italics</h3>

<p>Use italics for the names of exhibitions, except stand-alone exhibits like the Britten motorbike, the <em>Endeavour</em> cannon (<em>Endeavour</em> is in italics because it&rsquo;s a ship name), Phar Lap, and Tiger Moth.</p>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>Only some Te Papa exhibitions have Māori translations &ndash; though they should all have them from 2013.<br />
Do not translate the other exhibition names.</p>

<p>In English marketing text, use both only where it makes sense to do so (eg, <em>Ngā Toi </em><em>| Arts Te Papa</em>). Don&rsquo;t do so where the title would get too long and complicate the message. As an example, don&rsquo;t use <em>Road to Recovery: Disabled soldiers of World War I </em><em>| Te Ara Haumanu in ngā Hōia Hauā</em>. Instead use <em>Road to Recovery: Disabled soldiers of World War I</em>. In Māori marketing text, use the Māori version.
